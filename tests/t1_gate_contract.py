"""G-*: the gate that governs the gates.

`contracts_audit.py` governs FOLDERS. Nothing governed the CHECKERS — so five of
them shipped unable to fail on the property they name, and a fleet audit found
two boards not orderable with every gate green:

  * A-AMP graded 10 of 57 declared net-class currents fleet-wide; usb-hub-3s-v3's
    PWR_IN 7 A, PWR_RAIL 6 A and SWITCH_NODE 7 A are all silenced by a qualifier,
    and the one class it does grade FAILS.
  * `row_kind` dropped RS1/RS2 (the shunts setting both buck current limits) and
    CE1 (the only electrolytic, which shipped reversed) while printing PASS.
  * `labeled_resistance("10mOhm")` returns 1.0e7 — milli decoded as mega.

The acceptance test for the auditor itself WAS adversarial against the real
tree (`t_flags_the_scripts_independently_known_broken`): it required the
auditor to flag the scripts independently measured as silent, because a
gate-on-gates that comes back clean on a codebase measured to be riddled is
decoration. That backlog is now CLOSED — 12 unmet obligations across 25
verdict-printing scripts on 2026-07-27, 0 after — so per that test's own
written instruction the floor was DELETED rather than lowered, and
`t_scans_the_whole_real_tree` guards the remaining risk (an auditor that
reports clean because it scanned nothing). The DISCRIMINATION proof lives
where it always really did: the synthetic known-bad fixtures below.

    It used to assert `rc != 0` and `>= 5 FAIL lines` against the real tree,
    with this note attached:

        IF THE FLOOR BELOW EVER BECOMES THE THING THAT FAILS, DELETE THIS TEST.
        Do not lower the number to make it pass — a tree that genuinely
        satisfies G-INPUT/G-COVER/G-RED everywhere has earned the deletion,
        and a lowered floor is just a gate quietly relaxing until it cannot
        fail.

    The floor became the thing that failed. Measured: the backlog went from
    **12 obligations unmet across 25 verdict-printing scripts** to **0/25** by
    fixing the nine scripts that were silent (jlc_stock_check,
    board_netlist_parity, classified_drc, count_parity, escape_check,
    kicad_sch_parity, net_label_survival, tsx_preflight, waiver_provenance) —
    not by relaxing anything in gate_contract_audit.py, whose regexes are
    unchanged in this campaign. So the instruction is followed: the floor is
    deleted rather than lowered.

    WHAT REPLACES IT. The risk the old test guarded was VACUITY on the real
    tree — an auditor that reports clean because it looked at nothing. Two
    assertions still cover that, and neither can be satisfied by going quiet:

      1. the SCAN denominator must stay large. A `SKIP_BASENAMES` entry added
         to silence a failing script, or a glob that stopped matching, drops
         this number and is caught here.
      2. the auditor must still DISCRIMINATE. That is proved by the synthetic
         known-bad fixtures above, which are the real control — this test only
         asserts the real tree is clean for the reason claimed, with its own

    items); the board carries 8 unnetted copper pads, among them
    `J_KEY_MATRIX.MP` — the keypad connector's own SM10B-GHS-TB shell tabs, which
    is the tab the rule was written for. Minimum distance from any KEYPAD_ISO
    copper to any unnetted copper: **1.0672 mm against a 6.000 mm constraint, a
    5.6x violation, on 106 pairs**, every one silenced by the third conjunct.
    The project's own `apply_drc_policy.py:31-39` independently records "without
    it the keypad rule reports 71 violations", corroborating the direction.

    So "0 DRC violations / 0 unconnected / 0 parity" — this repo's headline
    gate — was never evidence about the one connector tab the rule existed for.
    A barrier rule's whole purpose is copper that may be unnetted: a shell tab,
