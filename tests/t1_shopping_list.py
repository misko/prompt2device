"""T1: canon M-QUOTE — a distributor number is a fact from OUTSIDE this repo.

Two incidents found this suite, and they are the same defect one level apart —
the ADJACENT-PROPERTY ERROR, measuring something NEAR the property you need:

  1. GHR-10V-S was reported to the user as available on a DigiKey SEARCH-RESULT
     SNIPPET reading "available to order today with same-day shipping". The
     PRODUCT PAGE said In Stock: 0. That sentence is boilerplate and renders at
     zero stock. The property measured was the state of a SEARCH PAGE.
  2. `10FDZ-BT(S)(LF)(SN)` exact-matched on the Mouser API returns ONE record:
     Availability null, LifecycleStatus **Obsolete**, MouserPartNumber "N/A",
     zero price breaks. The same part searched broad on the suffix-stripped
     `10FDZ-BT` returns **37 In Stock** at $0.96. The property measured was the
     state of a CATALOG ENTRY. It fires THROUGH a machine-readable API, which
     is why "use the API" is not by itself the lesson.

THE HEADLINE FIXTURES ARE BOTH REAL RESPONSES, recorded 2026-07-27 with the API
key redacted (it lives in the query string, never in a body) and replayed —
`tests/fixtures/shopping_list/mouser/`. See that folder's README.md.

RED-VERIFIED, and here are the measurements (new-gate variant, per
tests/README "Adding a regression": `shopping_list.py` did not exist before this
change, so there is no pre-fix code to run the suite against; each headline was
verified against a DELIBERATELY NEUTERED checker and the neutering restored
byte-identical afterwards).

  * Q-WIDE neutered — `lookup()` made exact-only, i.e. the pre-fix method that
    produced incident 2, with the broad search recorded as having run:
      -> 12 passed, 5 FAILED. The two headlines
         (t_broad_search_rescues_the_obsolete_exact_record — 10FDZ-BT reported
         NOT sourceable at 37 in stock; t_exact_only_is_inconclusive_not_a_
         finding), plus three that the same neuter reaches BECAUSE it fabricates
         a successful broad search: t_a_neighbouring_mpn_is_never_substituted,
         t_failed_lookup_is_never_dropped, t_absent_key_degrades_loudly. All
         five are real: with only the exact search this tool cannot tell "the
         part is dead" from "I asked the wrong question".
  * Q-SNIPPET neutered — the `if src == "search_snippet"` branch bypassed so a
    snippet grades like a product page:
      -> 16 passed, 1 FAILED — t_search_snippet_is_never_a_stock_figure, with
         "SHOULD HAVE FAILED but exited 0". The 500-unit snippet sourced the
         line. That is GHR-10V-S reproduced exactly, on demand.
  * Q-IDENT neutered — the `same =` filter in `grade_mouser` replaced by `live`:
      -> 16 passed, 1 FAILED — t_a_neighbouring_mpn_is_never_substituted. The
         tool sourced B5B-XH-A-GU, a different connector, against B5B-XH-A.

  Current suite after the candidate-BOM/composed-pool and progress-ledger
  additions: 26 passed, 0 failed, 14 known-bad.
