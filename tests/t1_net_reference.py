"""T1: the NET-REFERENCE gate (canon E-NETREF) — net_reference_audit.py.

Motivating measurement (smc0985-cooksense v1.7, 2026-07-29): **10 of 123 net
names referenced by that board's rule files and dossiers are not nets on the
board**, and the fleet sweep this gate's landing commit records makes it 64 of
908 across six boards. Three of the ten had already been paid for:

  1. THE SILK PRINTED A GHOST — a keypad caption read `GND_ISO ONLY`, and
     `grep -c GND_ISO` on `cooksense.net` is 0. The only ISO-bearing net name on
     the board is `SPI_MISO`, which matches `GND_ISO` by SUBSTRING only. It
     reached the shipped F.Silkscreen.
  2. A SAFETY-RELEVANT BUDGET WAS UNENFORCEABLE — `TPS259573DSGR`'s eFuse input
     decoupling `keep_short` is addressed to `5V_SELV`, not a net on the board,
     so `5V_IN`/`5V_FUSED`/`5V_RPP` carry zero graded capacitors.
  3. A WHOLE RAIL WAS INVISIBLE TO A GRADER — `supplies: {N3V3: 3.3}`, the tsx
     AUTHOR-PREFIX form of the net the netlist calls `3V3`.

Case 3 was closed NARROWLY in `electrical_invariants.py` (fa22228) by checking
one field. This gate is the general one, at the width of the class (canon
M-WIDTH), over eleven enumerated reference kinds with the denominator printed.

RED-VERIFICATION (new-gate variant, per tests/README "Adding a regression").
`net_reference_audit.py` did not exist before this commit, so there is no
pre-fix code to swap in: MEASURED pre-fix output for every case below is
`/usr/bin/python3: can't open file '.../net_reference_audit.py': [Errno 2] No
such file or directory`, exit 2 — no gate, no verdict. Where a stronger red is
available it is taken instead of relying on that:

  * `t_ghost_only_a_substring` reproduces THE DEFECT MECHANISM inline — a
    naive containment resolver, which is how `GND_ISO` survived review — and
    asserts it reports the ghost RESOLVED while this gate fails it. That is a
    real RED against the wrong algorithm, not against an absent file.
  * `t_author_prefix_near_miss` asserts the DIAGNOSIS, not the exit code:
    with the two `N`-prefix rules deleted from `near_miss()` the fixture still
    FAILS but names no candidate, and a verdict that sends the author hunting
    is the false lead fa22228's post-mortem is about.
  * `t_real_cooksense_silk_ghost` and `t_real_fleet_denominators` read REAL
    project bytes read-only, so the incident itself is pinned, not a model of
    it.

Each known-bad fixture is a PASSING fixture broken in exactly ONE way, and the
other half of the discrimination is asserted too: a rule file whose every
reference resolves must PASS, and a legitimately-unresolvable reference must
land in the honest UNREACHED class rather than a FAIL. A check that only ever
fires one way ranks nothing.
