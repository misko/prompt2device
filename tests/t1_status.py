"""T1: the STATUS beacon — the READER's traffic light, and the GATE that makes
the beacon TRUE (`pcb_status.py` + `status_beacon_check.py`, canon M9/M-BEACON).

Motivating incident (usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.2, 2026-07-23): agents only signalled at
coarse GATE boundaries, so between gates the coordinator was blind — it could
not tell "one tap from done" from "stalled" without reading a multi-MB
transcript. The STATUS beacon fixes that; the first half of this suite proves
the READER's traffic light actually bites: a `working` board that stopped
writing its beacon and holds no running op is flagged STALLED, while a fresh
one, a live-pid one, and a done one are not.

The gate there is the STALENESS classification. RED-VERIFIED inline
(`t_stall_logic_has_teeth`): the same stale fixture the reader flags STALLED is
shown NOT-stalled under a broken classifier that drops the age test — same
input, opposite verdict — which is exactly the logic under test. The reader is
NEW (no prior version to swap in per tests/README), so this working-vs-broken
comparison on one fixture is the red-verify the workflow calls for.

SECOND HALF — canon M-BEACON, added 2026-07-27. M9 made the beacon MANDATORY;
nothing made it TRUE, and the reader is happy to render a stale frame. MEASURED
on the fleet the day the gate landed, `status_beacon_check.py` returned
**13 findings across 4 of 6 beacons**:

    crow-mic-pod-v2      4x M-BEACON-DUP + M-BEACON-REL (v1.2 vs live v1.3)
                         + M-BEACON-AGE (updated 2026-07-26 < the v1.3 seal)
    crow-recorder-c-v2   M-BEACON-REL (v1.5 vs live v1.6) + M-BEACON-AGE
    cooksense            M-BEACON-FIELD (no step/op_pid/updated) + M-BEACON-AGE
    usb-hub-3s-v3        M-BEACON-FIELD + M-BEACON-REL (v1.9 vs live v1.10)
                         + M-BEACON-AGE
    interposer, pluto    PASS (the controls — interposer's beacon WAS refreshed
                         at its own seal, same day, and names its live release)

Three of those boards were fixed in the same change; **usb-hub-3s-v3 WAS LEFT
FAILING ON PURPOSE.** Its v1.11 seal was in another agent's hands at that
moment, and whether the seal RITUAL refreshes the beacon is the exact question
this gate exists to answer. Leaving it is the live proof: if v1.11 lands and
usb-hub still fails M-BEACON, the process fix (the beacon-refresh step now in
SKILL.md and the 07_releases seal procedure) was necessary — measured on a real
seal instead of a fixture. This suite therefore does NOT assert usb-hub's
verdict either way; it asserts the gate's PROPERTIES, on the real drifted bytes
in `fixtures/beacons/` (verbatim from commit 98f4c3a, see its PROVENANCE.md) run
against the REAL sealed release directories. No synthetic beacon was written
for the known-bad side: four real ones were wrong.
