"""t1_adr_bounds — an ADR's PUBLISHED BOUND is REGENERATED, not typed.

==========================================================================
THE INCIDENT (2026-07-29, smc0985-cooksense ADR-0024)
==========================================================================

The ADR "every pod-mateable safety input is hardened AT THE PINOUT" published,
as the one-line takeaway of a document whose entire argument is worst-case:

    General bound: V <= 0.700 V  =>  R_pd <= 592 Ohm

**592 Ohm is the NOMINAL corner** — 3.300 V rail, 2200 Ohm injected pull-up
exactly, R_pd at +/-0 %. At the corner the rest of the section uses (rail
3.399 V from `power_tree.yaml`'s 3V3 `vout_max`, injection 2178 Ohm = 2.2k -1 %,
R_pd +1 %) the bound is **559.283 Ohm**.

The 33 Ohm was not a rounding note. **560 Ohm is the nearest E24 value under
592, it is the value a future pass reaches for under that ceiling, and at the
worst-case corner it gives 0.700712 V and FAILS by 0.7 mV.** The published bound
permitted exactly one standard value and that value does not clear. The chosen
470 Ohm is unaffected (0.608250 V, +91.8 mV), so the BOARD was never wrong — the
ADR was. THE FAILURE IS THE ONE THE ADR IS NAMED AFTER, REPRODUCED IN ITS OWN
SUMMARY LINE.

Every number in this suite is re-derived independently of the ADR's prose by
`DIVIDER_PY` below, which is written from the topology (a pod pull-up against
the board's pull-down) and not copied from the document. Measured here:

    exact worst-case bound   559.2830 Ohm   (ADR: 559.3)
    exact nominal bound      592.3077 Ohm   (ADR: 592)
    560 Ohm @ worst_case     0.700712 V     (ADR: 0.7007, fails by 0.7 mV)
    549 Ohm @ worst_case     0.689741 V     (ADR: passes by 10.3 mV)
    499 Ohm @ worst_case     0.638728 V     (ADR: passes by 61.3 mV)
    470 Ohm @ worst_case     0.608250 V     (ADR: 0.608, PASS +92 mV)
    680 Ohm @ worst_case     0.814868 V     (ADR: 0.8149, FAIL by 115 mV)
    592.3 Ohm @ worst_case   0.732420 V     -> B-CORNER: not on its own edge

FLEET DENOMINATOR, measured by the gate on 2026-07-29 at main tip: **72 ADRs
(7 repo-level + 65 across 6 live boards); 37 publish at least one numeric
inequality bound; 108 such bounds in total; 0 declare a `<!-- bound -->`
block.** (A survey that counted `*.md` reported 78 documents — six of those are
the per-folder `contracts.md`, which carry no bounds; the 37 is unchanged.)

==========================================================================
RED-VERIFIED, both required senses
==========================================================================

**(1) Against the repo as it stood.** Nothing in this repo read a number out of
`01_docs/decisions/*.md`. Asserted, not asserted-about, by
`t_red_no_pre_existing_gate_reads_a_number_out_of_an_adr`: the ADR-0024 bound
`R_pd <= 592` sat in a live document through a full revision cycle and every
gate in the tree was green on it. There is no earlier version of this checker to
swap back in, so the pre-fix state is measured as an absence.

**(2) Against pre-fix code, by ablation.** `_ablated()` writes a copy of
`adr_bound_provenance.py` with the two incident checks — B-CORNER and B-STDVAL —
excised and nothing else touched, and the headline fixture is run against it.
MEASURED pre-fix output on the real published 592 Ohm bound, verbatim, EXIT 0:

    input: root = /tmp/adrb_74zdjqit  (1 ADR file(s) under docs/decisions + */01_docs/decisions)
    input: regeneration ON, cwd for commands = /tmp/adrb_74zdjqit, per-command timeout 180s
    input: 1 ADR(s) declare a `<!-- bound -->` block (1 block(s)); 0 OWED; 3 inequality bound(s) appear in prose across all 1
      UNVERIFIED  adrb_74zdjqit/0024-incident.md [R_PD_MAX]: regenerated 592.3077 vs published 592.3 (delta 0.0077 <= 0.05)
    BOUND COVERAGE: 0 CITED / 0 ESTIMATED / 1 UNVERIFIED across 1 declared block(s) in 1 ADR(s); 0 of 1 bound-publishing ADR(s) OWED (floors: CITED >= 0, OWED <= 37; NOT ENFORCED — foreign tree)
    ADR BOUND PROVENANCE: PASS (0 fails) — 1/1 ADR(s) publish an inequality bound, 1 declare one

i.e. pre-fix the run is GREEN on the incident bound: `regenerated 592.3077 vs
published 592.3 (delta 0.0077 <= 0.05)`. A `command:` solving at the NOMINAL
corner AGREES with the typed 592.3 to four decimal places, so the M4-shaped half
of this gate — diff the number against a re-runnable command — IS SATISFIED BY
THE DEFECT. The whole finding lives in the two checks that ask what the bound
ADMITS, which is why they are separate check IDs. (The `UNVERIFIED` rather than
`CITED` is an artifact of the ablation being surgical: it removes the two
`fails.append` sites and leaves the grade demotion that followed them. The
verdict, which is what matters, is PASS.)

BOTH HALVES. A bound that regenerates AND whose nearest standard value clears
must PASS and be reported CITED
(`t_a_correct_bound_regenerates_and_its_nearest_standard_value_clears`) — a gate
that only knows how to reject ranks nothing.

    Registered as `clean` rather than `kind="vacuity"` on purpose: binding a
    vacuity fixture requires a `VACUITY:` block in the gate's docstring AND
    raising `gate_contract_audit.VACUITY_FLOOR` from 5 to 6, and that file is
    owned elsewhere in this session (a vacuity fixture with no declaration, or a
    declaration with no fixture, is itself a G-VACUOUS FAIL — so the pair must
    land together). The gate declares the blind spot in prose under "THE BLIND
    SPOT THIS LEAVES OPEN"; the one-line patch that promotes this fixture is in
    the accompanying report.

    SUBJECT — the ADR-0024 defect IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM: `R_pd <= 592 Ohm`
    written as prose in a worst-case document, with no `<!-- bound -->` block.
    The gate PASSES it. That is 37 of 37 documents and 108 bounds on the day
    this landed, the incident bound among them.

    CONTRAST — the SAME false number moved into a block is caught by name,
    twice. Which is what makes this a blind spot rather than a fact the gate
    cannot represent at all.

@test("RED (1): five gates reach ADR paths and NONE of them reads a NUMBER out "

def t_red_no_pre_existing_gate_reads_a_number_out_of_an_adr():
    """There is no earlier version of this checker to swap back in, so the
    pre-fix baseline is measured directly — and the first measurement was WRONG
    in the safe direction, which is worth recording. "Nothing reaches the
    decisions folder" is false: FIVE scripts do.

    MEASURED at this commit, and inspected one by one:

      electrical_invariants.py  E-ADR. `protection_adrs()` globs `*.md` and
                                reads the TITLE, the `tags:` line and the
                                front-matter `status:`. Its demand is that a
                                protection/topology ADR be cited by some
                                invariant — a citation graph, not a value.
      module_first_check.py      validates that a bare-IC exception's `adr`
                                path resolves under `01_docs/decisions`; it
                                does not open or parse an ADR quantity.
      policy_audit.py           checks the folder EXISTS (`E-ADR N-A` when it
                                does not).
      power_topology.py         keyword-matches the first 400 characters for
                                batter|lipo|cell|pack to classify the supply.
      pcb_publication_gate.py   passes the decisions directory as a `git diff`
                                pathspec to detect material design drift. It
                                never opens an ADR; the proxy sees its review
                                `read_text` calls elsewhere in the same file.

    Not one of them extracts a quantity. `R_pd <= 592 Ohm` was a title away from
    every gate in the tree, sat in a live document through a full revision
    cycle, and everything was green on it.

    THE ASSERTION IS SET EQUALITY, and it is a proxy stated as one: proving "no
    ADR-derived string ever reaches a numeric comparison" needs a dataflow pass,
    so what is pinned instead is the READER SET. A sixth reader — or one of
    these five growing a number parser — breaks this test and forces the
    inspection above to be redone, which is the property that actually rots."""
