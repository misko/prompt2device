"""t1_copper_length — R-LEN: realized COPPER length, measured off the board.

THE DEFECT THIS SUITE PINS (measured 2026-07-29, before the gate existed).
`policy_audit.py`'s R-LEN row was:

    has_len = bool(re.search(r"length|spread", audit_src, re.I))
    rows.append(("R-LEN", "PASS" if has_len else "N-A", ...))

so R-LEN PASSED if the word "length" or "spread" appeared ANYWHERE in the
project's `03_src/audit_board.py` — a COMMENT satisfied it. Fleet state at that
moment: smc0985-cooksense PASS on two comments about a CREEPAGE SLOT being
lengthened; pluto-rx2-8way PASS on comments plus an I3 check that measures
pad-centre RADIUS (placement) and whose own text says
`STAGE-6 OBLIGATION: equalise ROUTED length to +/-0.10mm` with nothing
enforcing it; crow-recorder-central-v2 PASS honestly (it sums
`t.GetLength()`); and **pluto-cal-switch — the board whose release artifact IS
a published length delta — N-A, "no timing-critical nets declared"**.

`t_prefix_rlen_passes_on_a_comment` re-measures that vacuity against the REAL
cooksense source on every run, so it cannot quietly come back.

RED-VERIFIED, EVERY KNOWN-BAD, 2026-07-29. A brand-new gate has no "pre-fix
code" to swap back in, so the equivalent was done: each check was NEUTERED in
`copper_length_audit.py` one at a time and its own fixture re-run, then the file
was byte-restored (`diff -q` clean). Measured pre-fix output in every case:
`0 passed, 1 failed` / `0 known-bad`, i.e. the fixture stopped biting.

| neutered | fixture that went red |
|---|---|
| `if tol != "report" and spread > float(tol)` -> `if False` | the 1.5 mm spread |
| `if drift > float(pin["tol_mm"])` -> `if False` | the pin drift |
| `if d.get("no_vias") and gg["n_via"]` -> `if False` | the one via on one arm |
| `unm = [m for m in members if not m["measured"]]` -> `unm = []` | the zone / unpriced via / branch trio |
| `if ghosts:` -> `if False:` | the unrouted board |
| `if not d.get("congruent_pads"):` -> `if False:` | the incongruent-pads spread |
| `raise AuditError("unparseable (segment ...)")` -> `continue` | the truncated segment |
| `if not d.get(req):` -> `if False:` | the seven malformed declarations |

The other headline is the M1 independence claim:
`t_reader_agrees_with_pcbnew` measures this gate's pcbnew-free reader against
pcbnew's own `PCB_TRACK.GetLength()` on four real routed boards. Measured at
landing: **351 nets, 0 disagreements above 1 um.**
