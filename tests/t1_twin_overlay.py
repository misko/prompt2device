"""T1: twin_overlay.py — canon A-RENDER, the gate that asks whether the twin
RENDER is faithful to the BOARD.

THE INCIDENT (2026-07-26). `twin_overlay.py` shipped with a checker's
docstring and computed NO BODY POSITION ANYWHERE. It projected courtyards out
of the board and drew boxes; its only non-zero exits concerned the IMAGE. It
was wired into no pipeline stage, had no contract Audit row, and had no
known-bad fixture, so nothing could observe that it graded nothing. Meanwhile
the thing it claimed to catch had already shipped twice: crow-recorder-central-
v2 v1.4 and v1.5 sealed with J2, the board's only USB-C, rendered 90 DEGREES
ROTATED, because `jlc_twin` mounted the body at a pad fit it had ITSELF
rejected in the same breath (`PAD-MISMATCH best=(4.5947, False, 90)`).

Two constraints decide whether this suite is worth anything:

  (A) CANON M1 — the measured side must come from PIXELS. A gate that
      recomputed the body position from the mesh and the mount transform
      would AGREE WITH A WRONG MOUNT, which is the defect itself.
  (B) The reference is the EXPECTED POSITION, never the courtyard. J1's
      barrel-jack mesh really is 5.686 mm off its courtyard centre; gating
      that would fail J1 forever and produce a waiver, and an inherited
      waiver is how the refdes-on-silk defect crossed three boards (canon M4).

RED-VERIFIED against the pre-fix code. Every known-bad below was run against
`git show HEAD~:skills/jlcpcb-fab/scripts/twin_overlay.py` (the 232-line
drawing tool) and the outcome recorded in the test's own docstring. The
headline: on the SEALED v1.5 render the pre-fix tool exits **0** with
"OVERLAY OK: 203 courtyards, 16 flagged, 15 crops"; the gate exits **1** with
"OVERLAY FAIL: 1 unfaithful ref(s): J2 (centre 1.44mm, outward 1.49mm)".

FIXTURES. The board, the BOM, the CPL and the renders are read from the SEALED
v1.5 release, read-only, never written. JLC's own CAD for the six LCSC codes
the tests need is vendored under `fixtures/twin_overlay/` — see its
PROVENANCE.md, including the one deliberate byte-level edit.

      "the resolvability floor is EXCLUDED, not graded",

def t_vacuity_a_body_under_the_resolvability_floor_is_excluded_not_graded():
    """THE DECLARED BLIND SPOT (canon G-VACUOUS; the executable half of the
    `VACUITY:` block in twin_overlay.py's docstring).

    This fixture asserts the gate PASSES while the fact it grades — "every
    placed part is where the board says it is" — is FALSE. It is not a
    known_bad; it PINS a defect so it cannot be forgotten, and closing the
    defect is expected to break it (then it becomes a known_bad).

    THE MECHANISM. `fails` is built over `graded` only, and two exclusions run
    first, neither able to fail: `unresolvable` (expected body under
    `MIN_BODY_MM = 2.0` in either dimension) and `no_model`. So a 0402 at
    1.0 x 0.5 mm is outside the verdict BY CONSTRUCTION.

    MEASURED on the sealed v1.5 release this suite fixtures against:

        COVERAGE: 2 measured / 23 with an expected body; 21 unresolvable,
        0 resolvable-but-unmeasured, 162 no-model, 203 courtyards drawn

    Two assertions, and the second is the load-bearing one:

      1. the gate passes a faithful render while reporting that denominator —
         so 201 of 203 parts are ungraded and the exit code does not say so;
      2. a part on the unresolvable list is ungraded EVEN WHEN THE BOARD MOVES
         IT. J1's body is 14.4 x 9.3 mm so it IS graded; the fixture instead
         picks a ref the gate itself listed as unresolvable and displaces it
         3 mm, which is 3x the 1.00 mm tolerance. `t_displaced_body_fails` does
         exactly this to J1 and the gate FAILS. Here it exits 0.

    That contrast is the whole content of the declaration: the same 3 mm
    displacement is caught on a 14 mm part and invisible on a 2 mm one."""
