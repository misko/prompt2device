"""T1: the ASSEMBLY gates — A-POP (`assembly_coverage.py`) and A-STOCK
(`release_freshness_check.py` check (e)).

PCBA is the deliverable, but until 2026-07-25 nothing in `skills/`, `scripts/`
or `tests/` had ever read a `cpl.csv` back. Of policy_audit's 32 check IDs
exactly one touched a fab-order artifact and it graded only `bom.csv`. So both
defect classes below reached a SEALED release and were found by a human
reading bytes:

  A-POP   cooksense v1.1 ships 13 CPL placement rows whose BOM line carries a
          BLANK LCSC (J_TC + the twelve K_* Standex relays). Its MANIFEST
          declares 12 of them not_assembled — JLC was told to PLACE parts the
          order paperwork says are unassembled, and to source a 13th declared
          nowhere. The interposer v1.0 ships the same class with no
          `not_assembled:` line at all. crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.3 declares
          its PLACED, consigned U1 "not_assembled".
  A-STOCK five sealed releases ship stock evidence whose LAST LINE says FAIL.
          crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.0-v1.3 each record their own CPU
          (C6938291, the XU316 SoC) at LOW_STOCK(0). cooksense v1.1 ships a
          raw `--out` CSV report with ZERO verdict lines, so the gate must not
          be silenceable by simply omitting the verdict.

RED-VERIFICATION, two kinds, both performed:

 1. NEW-GATE variant (A-POP). `assembly_coverage.py` did not exist before this
    commit — at HEAD~ there is no such file, so every A-POP case below fails
    with "no such file" and the gate could not exist. What that cannot prove is
    that a finding comes from the check it names, so every A-POP known-bad ALSO
    carries an INLINE red-verify: re-run with the `--_disable-<family>` hook and
    assert the SAME fixture now passes. A finding that survives its own check
    being neutered is a finding from somewhere else.
 2. GIT-SWAP variant (A-STOCK). check (e) is an addition to an existing gate,
    so it was verified the documented way (tests/README step 3). MEASURED
    2026-07-25: with `git show HEAD:.../release_freshness_check.py` swapped
    back in, `--only=A-STOCK` reports **1 passed, 10 failed**; restored, 11
    passed, 0 failed. The one that survives is `t_stock_sourcing_plan_clears`,
    a clean case that asserts the ABSENCE of a finding — vacuously true when
    the check does not exist, which is exactly why a clean case alone proves
    nothing and every teeth-bearing case here is a known_bad.

Sealed releases are IMMUTABLE and are opened READ-ONLY here. Every scratch
tree is built by COPYING the minimal orderable subset out of them; nothing is
ever written back. Assertions are PROPERTIES — exit codes, finding strings,
named refdes sets — never file bytes: a re-export legitimately reorders CSV
rows.

HERMETICITY, learned the hard way the same day (2026-07-25): a sealed release
is immutable, but `discover()` walks OUT of it to
`projects/<b>/03_src/rules/assembly.yaml`, which is LIVE. Within an hour of
this suite landing, the usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.5 agent authored that project's
assembly.yaml and `t_pop_manifest_prose` flipped from pass to fail with no
code change on either side. Reading immutable bytes is not enough — every
input the checker RESOLVES must be pinned. Tests whose premise is "this
release sealed with no assembly.yaml" now pass `no_asm()`, making that
historical fact explicit instead of inheriting today's working tree.

    `jlc_stock_check.py` grades `stockCount`, which is LCSC CATALOG stock. JLC's
    assembly uploader allocates from a DIFFERENT pool. usb-hub v1.11's
    predecessor shipped this very sidecar reading

        C25744 ... "status": "OK", "stock": 291      "verdict": "PASS"

    and JLC refused that exact line the same day with "10 shortfall", because
    LCSC held 291 and JLC's assembly warehouse held none. The gate was not
    wrong about the number it measured; it was silent about which number that
    was, and `release_freshness` A-STOCK READS this file.

    So the PROPERTY is not "the verdict is correct" -- it is that the verdict
    CARRIES ITS OWN SCOPE, because a downstream reader has no other way to know.
    A gate that reports a true fact about the wrong pool, without saying which
    pool, is the adjacent-property error with a machine-readable interface.

    Runs OFFLINE: the sidecar is written before the zero-coverage exit, so an
    all-uncoded BOM exercises the writer with no network at all.
