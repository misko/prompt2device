"""S-OCCL — the direction-aware schematic occlusion model (`sch_occlusion.py`).

THE DEFECT THESE FIXTURES PIN. The shipped S-OCCL, inline in `policy_audit.py`,
modelled every global_label plate as a HORIZONTAL box and sent every non-180
angle to `+x`:

    if ang == 180: (gx - wlen, ..., gx, ...)   else: (gx, ..., gx + wlen, ...)

`justify` was read nowhere, the vertical axis did not exist, and no symbol
geometry of any kind was on the page. MEASURED on pluto-rx2-8way-v2: 4 findings
before the converter fix at 948ef54d and 4 after, with 3 of the 4 REPLACED — a
gate that could see neither the defect nor its repair.

THE RED SIDE IS RE-MEASURED EVERY RUN, not asserted in a docstring: `prefix()`
below EXTRACTS the pre-fix block from `git show 948ef54d:...policy_audit.py`
and RUNS it, so every known-bad here is a live comparison against the real
shipped bytes rather than against a paraphrase of them.

FOUR AXES, BOTH DIRECTIONS. A fixture exercising only the horizontal axis is
exactly the blind spot under repair, so each known-bad appears four times —
left, right, up, down — in two shapes: a plate fired INTO a symbol body (which
the old model cannot see at all, having no bodies), and a plate-vs-plate
overlap the old model MISSES BECAUSE IT POINTS THE PLATE THE WRONG WAY (which
is the direction defect proper, with symbol geometry taken out of the argument).

GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED, 2026-07-31, in addition to the per-run extraction above:
`occlusions()` was replaced wholesale by the block from
`git show 948ef54d:policy_audit.py` and this suite run — **4 passed / 12 failed
/ 0 known-bad**, with ALL NINE known-bad fixtures red and the vacuity fixture
red with them. Restored: **16 / 0 / 9 known-bad + 1 vacuity**. The four that
survive the swap are the ones that do not consult the direction model at all
(the ink measurement, the ink falsification, the fleet denominator, and the
prototype-exclusion check, which reads `parse_sheet` directly).

=====================================================================
THE SECOND DEFECT THESE FIXTURES PIN: A FIXED-WIDTH MODEL OVER A
PROPORTIONAL FONT (2026-07-31)
=====================================================================

`CH_W = 1.05` charged every character the same width and built a plate as
`(len(name) + 2) * CH_W`. KiCad's stroke font is PROPORTIONAL, and the flat
model is wrong in BOTH directions — MEASURED against the boxes KiCad itself
draws, on all 1507 real fleet plates: **too SHORT on 596 (worst 1.6654 mm),
too WIDE on 911 (worst 1.1173 mm), and EXACT ON ZERO OF THEM.** The corrected
model matches the rendered box to 0.000210 mm on all 1507, which is the SVG's
own 4-decimal quantisation and nothing else.

Too WIDE invents findings; too SHORT makes a REAL ink composite INVISIBLE, and
the fleet's own names take it that way: every capital letter advances 20/21 to
22/21 of the font size against a flat 1.05/1.27 = 17.4/21.

The red side of BOTH new fixtures is the REAL SHIPPED BYTES, exactly as above:
`flat()` loads `git show c90c51c3:sch_occlusion.py` — the whole module, direction
model and symbol geometry included, differing from HEAD in the WIDTH model
alone — and runs it, so each fixture is a live A/B against the flat model rather
than against a paraphrase of it. Two shapes, because the defect has two:

  * `t_flat_width_hides_a_real_overlap` — a 17-character capitalised name whose
    plate genuinely runs into its neighbour IN KiCad'S OWN INK, which the flat
    model scores CLEAN;
  * `t_flat_width_invents_an_overlap` — the mirror, an `IIII`-class narrow name
    the flat model scores DIRTY and whose plates KiCad draws 0.2469 mm APART.

GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED for the width fix, 2026-07-31: `sch_occlusion.py` was
replaced wholesale by `git show c90c51c3:...` and this suite run — **17 passed
/ 5 failed**, restored **22 / 0 / 11 known-bad + 1 vacuity**. Four of the five
red on the MEASUREMENT (missed overlap, invented overlap, a 1.6654 mm box
disagreement, a guessed character), one on the absence of the table itself; the
counts and the reasoning are recorded in `t_flat_width_hides_a_real_overlap`.

    """CANON M1, and the reason this test is long rather than a spot check.

    `circuit_json_to_kicad_sch.py` carries its own advance table for the same
    font. If S-OCCL simply imported it, the gate and the emitter would share a
    method and a common error would be invisible: the converter would place a
    plate it believed clear, the gate would agree, and KiCad would draw through
    the neighbour. So the gate carries its OWN table, DERIVED independently —
    and the only thing that keeps two independent tables honest is re-deriving
    one of them from the renderer on every run. That is what this does.

    FOUR MEASUREMENTS:

      1. ADVANCE, per character. Names `H + c*n + H` for n in {1,3,9}: the
         bracketing `H`s make the measurement immune to any leading/trailing
         trimming, and adv = (L9 - L1)/8 is cross-checked against (L3 - L1)/2
         so a non-linear glyph cannot slip through. MEASURED: every advance is
         an EXACT integer twenty-first of the font size, k from 8 to 28,
         residual below 0.0008 mm.
      2. PLATE BASE, per shape. MEASURED: passive 1.3341, input/output 2.4454,
         bidirectional/tri_state 3.5567 mm at the 1.27 mm font. The old model
         had one number and would have under-measured a non-passive plate by
         1.1 to 2.2 mm.
      3. PLATE CROSS, at three font sizes, asserted as a SET so the zero spread
         cannot be averaged away, and asserted to scale linearly with size.
      4. PROPERTY INK, above and below the anchor, per character. MEASURED: not
         symmetric (`p` reaches 1.0029 mm below at the 1.27 mm font, `A` only
         0.5795) and not constant, against the shipped SYMMETRIC 0.53 x 1.27.

    `CH_W = 1.05` charges 1.05 mm per character. Every capital in the fleet
    advances 20/21, 21/21 or 22/21 of the 1.27 mm font — 1.2095 to 1.3305 mm —
    so the flat plate is SHORT for every all-capitals name, and a plate the
    gate believes stops short of its neighbour is one KiCad draws straight
    through it.

    THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. Re-grading the eight fleet sheets across this fix
    turned up exactly two findings the flat model was hiding, and BOTH were
    confirmed against KiCad's own render:
      * crow-recorder-central-v2 `label USB_VDD33 x pin FB_u33.1` — the pin
        sits 12.065 mm from the anchor, flat reach 11.550, true 12.159, so
        0.0943 mm of the rendered pin line lies inside the rendered plate;
      * pluto-cal-switch `label HDR_CTRL_ADC x pin U_MCU.19` — pin at 15.240 mm,
        flat reach 14.700, true 15.304: the ENTIRE 1.2700 mm pin line is buried
        under the plate KiCad draws, and the flat model reported nothing.

    RED SIDE: the flat model is not paraphrased here, it is LOADED FROM GIT
    (`flat_module()`, FLAT_COMMIT) and run on the same file — same direction
    model, same symbol geometry, `CH_W = 1.05` the only difference.

    GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED, 2026-07-31. `skills/kicad-pcb/scripts/sch_occlusion.py`
    was replaced wholesale by `git show c90c51c3:...` and this suite run —
    **17 passed / 5 failed**; restored **22 passed / 0 failed / 11 known-bad +
    1 vacuity**. The five reds, and FOUR OF THEM RED ON THE MEASUREMENT rather
    than on a crash, which is the only kind of red that proves anything:

      this fixture           "SHOULD HAVE FAILED but exited 0" — the missed
                             overlap itself
      its mirror             "should have exited 0, got 1" — the invented one
      the upper bound        "the model box disagrees with the box KiCad DREW
                             by 1.665400 mm on some plate"

                             table for the fixture to re-derive.

    Both width fixtures assert through the CLI BEFORE touching any module
    attribute, precisely so the swap cannot red them for a renamed constant and
    leave the real claim untested; the first draft of this file did exactly
    that on five of six and it looked like a pass.

    The nine DIRECTION known-bads and the `label_sides_v` fixture stay GREEN
    under the swap — c90c51c3 already had the direction model right — which is
    the discrimination that makes these five mean "the width model", not "some

    property is asserted rather than implied — on the REAL fleet, not on a
    probe, because a probe cannot be accused of being chosen.

    THREE CLAIMS, all measured here every run:

      1. `plate_box` equals the plate KiCad draws. MEASURED: worst edge
         disagreement 0.000210 mm over 1507 plates — the SVG's own 4-decimal
         quantisation. The FLAT model, run over the same 1507, is too SHORT on
         596 (worst 1.6654 mm) and too WIDE on 911 (worst 1.1173 mm) and EXACT
         ON ZERO.
      2. the label's own glyph run sits strictly INSIDE its plate box with the
         0.1524 mm pen counted (MEASURED minimum margin 0.4029 mm), so the box
         bounds the ink and not merely the outline.
      3. the advance sum is an upper bound on a run's drawn ink — the last
         character's trailing side bearing is advanced over and never drawn.

    THE RESIDUAL IS NAMED, not hidden. This is a CENTRELINE model: KiCad strokes
    every glyph and plate with a 0.1524 mm pen, so ink reaches 0.0762 mm beyond
    every centreline — on BOTH sides of every comparison. Two objects whose
    centreline boxes overlap therefore certainly overlap in ink; two clearing
    each other by less than 0.1524 mm may still touch and are not reported.
    Inflating instead is not available: it would make every label overlap the
    pin it attaches to by exactly the pen width (see
    `t_attachment_is_not_an_occlusion`).
