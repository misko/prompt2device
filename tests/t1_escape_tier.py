"""T1: escape feasibility + fab tier gates — escape_check.py and the
policy_audit P-ESC / P-TIER checks (canon P7).

Motivating incident (2026-07-20, commit 6ae4a4c): the clean-room 3S run
selected a 0.5mm-pitch QFN-10 (SY8368) with the fab tier defaulted to
standard; the unmade ADVANCED decision surfaced two stages later as
drill_out_of_range at DRC, and the escape analysis lived only in a chat
report. These gates move that failure to the PARTS stage.

RED-VERIFIED: the known-bad cases below were run against the pre-gate
policy_audit.py (git show 656bab3:...policy_audit.py swapped in): every
P-ESC/P-TIER case failed with "report has no row for P-ESC/P-TIER" —
the gate did not exist, so nothing could block the incident. Restored and
re-run green 2026-07-21.

v2 (Phase F, 2026-07-21): the CONDITIONAL escape-budget model. The
calibration table below is paid-for ground truth in both directions —
xt60-usb-supply-rerun SHIPPED the SY8368 x3 at STANDARD tier with
outward-only escapes (a4ff7ed) while the v2 clean-room STALLED the same
part, and usb-pwr-hub-3s ADR-0008 measured the dense-leaded LM5116 wall.
The v2 known-bad cases were RED-VERIFIED against the pre-v2 escape_check
(git show 656bab3 swap): the conditional-clean cases FAIL there (the model
could only say 'advanced always') and the conditions-mismatch cases fail
with the wrong reason — details per test.

# design), which is exactly when a silent pass misleads most.
#
# MEASURED fleet-wide 2026-07-28: 61 of 119 declared keep_short budgets — 51%
