"""T1: bom_source_check.py + the export_jlc_package grouping fix.

The incident (usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.1, 2026-07-23)
---------------------------------------------
The KiCad board carries only a Value string per footprint ("10uF"), never the
LCSC code. `export_jlc_package.py` grouped footprints by (Value, Footprint) and
re-attached codes from a value-token carry-over — so two DISTINCT parts sharing
a value+footprint collapsed onto ONE BOM row under a SINGLE code:

  source: C9-C12,C24-C27 = C77102 (10uF *50V*)  ·  C49,C50 = C77100 (10uF *25V*)
  shipped BOM: all ten on one row coded C77100 → 25V caps on a 50V input rail.

and the 100uF output cap was substituted C84455 (10V) → C90143 (16V). The BOM
passed every gate because none compared it to the source.

Two things are pinned here:
  1. the GATE (`bom_source_check.py`) FAILS a merged / substituted / missing /
     dropped-vendored BOM and PASSES a correct one — including the REAL sealed
     v1.1 artifact (regression fixture);
  2. the EXPORTER, given the source circuit.json, splits two distinct-code caps
     onto SEPARATE rows (the fix) — red-verified in the docstring against the
     pre-fix (Value,Footprint) grouping which re-merges them.
