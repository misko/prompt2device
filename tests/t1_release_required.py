    was wrong: `export_jlc_package.py` wrote `fab/bom_jlc.csv` and
    `fab/cpl_jlc.csv` while this contract — and all 34 sealed releases —
    require `fab/bom.csv` and `fab/cpl.csv`. Every seal bridged the two names
    by HAND-COPYING, which is what kept the mismatch invisible for the fleet's
    whole history.

    IT IS NOT COSMETIC. `release_freshness_check.py` resolves A-STOCK and A-BUY
    through `fab/bom.csv`. On pluto-rx2-8way-v2's staged archive the hand-copy
    did not happen, so both gates reached a ZERO DENOMINATOR and emitted NOTES
    ("no coded, placed line to grade" / "sourcing UNGRADED — 0 line(s)
    measured") rather than failures — two gates that exist BECAUSE five sealed
    releases shipped failing stock evidence, silent over an empty set. Adding
    only the two correctly-named copies flipped them to `11 graded line(s),
    verdict=PASS` / `SOURCING: CLEAR`.

    So this test runs the REAL exporter and copies its output into a release
    WITHOUT RENAMING ANYTHING — the property is that no rename is needed.

    RED-VERIFIED 2026-07-31: `bom_path = out / "bom_jlc.csv"` and
    `open(out / "cpl_jlc.csv", ...)` swapped back into the exporter and this
    test run — the exporter still exits 0, but the `must_pass` on
    `release_required_check` FAILS with
    `MISSING required artifact: fab/bom.csv` and `... fab/cpl.csv`, i.e. RED on
    exactly the two rows. Fix restored, test re-run green.

    The known-bad half is the CONTRAST at the end: put the exporter's output
    back under the legacy names and the same check must FAIL, so this test
    cannot pass by grading nothing."""
