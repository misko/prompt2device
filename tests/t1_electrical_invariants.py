"""T1: the ELECTRICAL-INVARIANTS gate (E1, netlist-only) — electrical_invariants.py.

Motivating incident (2026-07-21, usb-hub-3s v1.0, external + red-team review):
the D1 reverse-polarity defect passed ERC, DRC, netlist parity, jlc_twin AND
pin review. Every artifact was consistently WRONG TOGETHER — symbol, footprint,
netlist, board all agreed D1's cathode sat on VBAT_F; only DESIGN INTENT (D1 is
the reverse-polarity block, its cathode feeds VIN) disagreed, and intent was
not executable. This gate makes intent executable: ADRs emit netlist assertions.

RED-VERIFIED (new-gate variant, per tests/README "Adding a regression"):
electrical_invariants.py did not exist before this change — the suite cannot be
run against pre-fix code because the gate could not exist. Instead each
known-bad fixture is a PASSING fixture broken in exactly ONE way, and the test
asserts the checker fails for the RIGHT reason (naming the assertion + the
actual net found). THE INCIDENT itself is pinned as a known-bad fixture reading
the real sealed v1.0 netlist (D1.1 -> VBAT_F).

# unplugged the supervisor self-pulsed, WD_OK never fell and the external
# COOKING CONTACTOR stayed energised indefinitely. The fix landed the pull-down
# AT 100k. TI SLVS165O S6.5 gives I_IL at WDI = 190 uA MAX and the pin SOURCES
# it, so the hold resistor is bounded by I_IL x R < V_IL:
#     R_max = (0.3 x 3.3 V) / 190 uA = 0.99 V / 190 uA ~= 5.2k

# and ALL THREE E-INV assertions that landed with the fix — one net_has_part

# on WD_PET with its pads on the right nets. The commit body: "An invariant

# ================================================ `adr:` YAML OCTAL (2026-07-27)
# THE DEFECT, reported by the pluto-cal-switch agent. A zero-padded ADR
# reference written BARE is a YAML 1.1 OCTAL literal:
#     adr: 0011 -> the int 9  -> _norm_adr -> "0009"
#     adr: 0012 -> the int 10 -> _norm_adr -> "0010"
#     adr: 0010 -> the int 8  -> _norm_adr -> "0008"
#     adr: 0008 -> the STRING "0008" (8 is not an octal digit; it survives)
# So it is not a SKIP — the invariant silently satisfies the WRONG ADR, and
# E-ADR then credits an ADR that emitted nothing while reporting the intended
# one as uncited. Measured on this tree before the fix: the pcb-design TEMPLATE
# (`skills/pcb-design/templates/03_src/rules/electrical_invariants.yaml`, the
# source of truth every new board is seeded from) and the pluto-cal-switch copy
# taken from it both wrote `adr: 0011` and both RESOLVED IT TO 0009. The live
# pluto-cal-switch file cites 0011 AND 0012 — the two the reporter named.
#
# The fix REJECTS the bare form rather than coercing it, because coercion is
# impossible after the fact: safe_load has already turned 0011 into 9, and
# `adr: 9` and `adr: 0011` are then the same object.

    Here a decoy dossier declares `mpn: CRX` — the LCSC code of the real
    receiver — and a threshold that flips the grade: `v_ih_min: 5.0`, which the
    3.300 V node cannot reach. (A FRACTION does not discriminate here and my
    first attempt at this fixture used one: 0.99 x 3.3 = 3.267 V, and the node
    sits AT the rail on 3.300, so it passed with either dossier answering. A
    fixture that cannot tell the two apart proves nothing.) It lives in
    `ZDECOY/` so that it
    sorts AFTER the real `PART/` dossier: that ordering is the whole point,
    because a single-pass loader with plain assignment is last-write-wins and
    would hand the lookup to the decoy. Precedence is explicit in the loader —
    sourcing codes are applied AFTER name-derived keys — so the real dossier
    wins whatever the glob order.
