"""T1: the SCHEMA-READER gate (canon G-ORPHAN) — schema_reader_audit.py.

Motivating measurement: **a declared field that nothing reads is worse than an
absent one, because it reads as covered.** `02_parts/*/part.yaml` may declare
`layout.adjacency:` and until 2026-07-29 P-ADJ read `keep_short` entries ONLY,
so pluto-rx2-8way's requirement that `U_ESD` sit within ~2.0 mm of `J_USB` —
where 6 nH per 10 mm of loop turns a 17 V clamp into a 305 V spike — was graded
by NO GATE AT ALL while sitting in source as if it were live. A human had to
hand-measure it. Same week, same class: `length_match:` did not exist as a
schema until R-LEN landed, on two boards whose release artifact IS a length
delta; `pins.<N>.tie` names a net on 84 pins across 43 dossiers and nothing
reads it, which is the field class the `GND_ISO` ghost that reached shipped silk
lived in.

The first run of this gate found four more (all four are asserted below, against
REAL project and REAL script bytes, in `t_real_findings_*`):

  1. `policy_waivers.yaml [].refs` — a waiver is applied by `id` ALONE.
  2. `power_tree.yaml linear_rails[]` — five cooksense rails, full envelopes,
     read only by a docstring paragraph explaining they are ignored.
  3. `nets.yaml classes.<C>.intent`/`routing`/`verify` — REQUIRED per class,
     filled in on 38 fleet classes, read by nothing, not even their presence.
  4. `length_match.<G>.phase` — "a reporting aid" that does not reach the report.

RED-VERIFICATION (new-gate variant, per tests/README "Adding a regression").
`schema_reader_audit.py` did not exist before this commit, so there is no
pre-fix code to swap in: MEASURED pre-fix output for every case here is
`/usr/bin/python3: can't open file '.../schema_reader_audit.py': [Errno 2] No
such file or directory`, exit 2 — no gate, no verdict. Where a stronger red is
available it is taken instead of leaning on an absent file:

  * `t_mention_in_a_docstring_is_not_a_read` reproduces THE DEFECT ALGORITHM
    inline — `re.search(key, source_text)`, which is exactly the retired R-LEN
    predicate that passed smc0985-cooksense on two comments about a creepage
    slot being lengthened — and asserts it credits the reader while this gate
    FAILS it. That is a real RED against the wrong algorithm.
  * `t_advisory_declared_passes_undeclared_fails` is the both-halves
    discrimination on ONE input: the same key, same tree, one line of contract
    changed, opposite verdicts.
  * `t_real_findings_*` and `t_real_fleet_denominator` read REAL bytes
    read-only, so the incidents are pinned rather than modelled.

Every known-bad fixture here is a PASSING fixture broken in exactly ONE way.

    This fixture first asserted that NEITHER `policy_audit.py` nor
    `waiver_provenance.py` reads `refs:`. Within the hour the M4 evidence work
    landed `W-REFS`, which resolves path-shaped `refs:` and validates that a
    cited line span exists — so `waiver_provenance.py` now genuinely reads it and
    the fixture correctly refused to keep claiming otherwise.

    What survives is sharper: **`refs:` is OVERLOADED.** Most fleet entries use
    it as an EVIDENCE POINTER (file paths, now validated by W-REFS); three use it
    as a SCOPE (refdes lists), and `policy_audit.py` — the only consumer that
    could honour a scope — still builds `waived_ids` from `w["id"]` alone. So
    cooksense's `P-SILK-FN` waiver names 22 refdes and silences that check
    BOARD-WIDE; a 23rd failing refdes is silent, on the board carrying a 30 V
    NOT-SELV terminal where connector labelling is the safety story.

    The ambiguity is the reason nobody noticed: a reader who checks whether
    `refs:` is read finds that it is, and stops. The fixture therefore pins the

    same shape as the `mechanical`/`assembly_coverage.py` collision above. The
    DISCRIMINATING segment is `polarity_marks`, and it occurs exactly once.

    RED-VERIFY, BOTH DIRECTIONS, ON ONE TREE, WITH REAL SHIPPED BYTES — the
    reader is the actual `generate_board_generic.py`, not a model of it.
    Removing the one `.get("polarity_marks")` call is the pre-fix generator as
    far as these rows are concerned.

    MEASURED 2026-07-30 against the LIVE repo, by neutering that call in place:
    `312/315 graded OK, 251 PROVEN, 3 UNREAD`, all three findings reading
    `'polarity_marks' does not appear in any read position at all`, plus the
    floor breach `251 ... below the committed floor of 254` — and NOT ONE of
    them named `ref`, `pad` or `text`, which is the decoy reads doing exactly
    what this fixture claims. Restored: `315/315, 254 PROVEN, 0 orphan`."""
