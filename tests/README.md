`t1_pipeline_qualification.py` runs an isolated native clean/hostile control
pair and checks missing tools, unsupported reporting and stale cache rejection.

Same-owner dispatch tests exercise a real wrong-directory failure followed by
a successful correction, plus changed premises, mandatory boundaries and
relabeling/branching at an exhausted cumulative allowance. The initial-launch
replay test was RED against the 022af552 runtime, then GREEN with the durable
campaign claim.

Schema-2 delivery tests in `t1_pipeline_runtime.py` reproduce exit-zero with
missing handback as RED against the cfa87025 runtime, then GREEN with output
validation. They also exercise stale subjects, unresolved reports, retained
partial evidence, provider failure, unknown cleanup and late terminal callbacks.
Schema-1 execution and artifact transaction tests remain compatibility controls.

`t1_connector_orientation.py` binds full native scene/model dependencies and
explicit resolver propagation, rejects missing nonconnector models, and checks
that occluder geometry/transforms/model bytes, visibility and camera semantics
stale both approval schemas. Pure routing additions remain reusable. Strict
schema-1 image hash/key rejection and schema-2 unchanged-semantic pixel
regeneration are separate controls. Approval/continuation must reuse the exact
verified user-viewed bundle; absent, stale or tampered bundles cannot be signed
by the approval flag. The regressions were RED against the exact pre-fix gate,
then GREEN after correction. The first missing-model fixture mistakenly edited
a copy returned by `Models()`; its result was discarded, the fixture was fixed
to assign back to the native model vector, and native RED was rerun.
Opposing-row camera recipes use full-frame top/board-rotation 300 or 60 degrees;
a declared vacuity fixture preserves the fact that machine axis/edge correctness
does not prove rear visibility through an occluder. Actual native elevated
images still require independent target attribution and explicit human review.

`t_receipt_integrity_native` additionally generates a real native USB scene,
adds a physical `U_OCCLUDER`, then relabels only the old receipt subject while
forbidding rendering. This was RED against candidate-two (false strict
approval of stale pixels), then GREEN with complete cached semantic/machine
and producer validation. It retains exact-reuse and physical routing-only
positive controls, closed-schema missing/extra/duplicate/malformed fields,
contradictory metadata and rehashed contradictory native commands, and changed
producer/observation/image/log bytes. The prior eighteen controls, including
schema-2 unchanged-semantic pixel compatibility and the visibility blind spot,
remain in this suite. Synthetic approvals are confined to disposable fixtures.

`t2_route_stitch.py` checks that importing a route into a regenerated board
retains the declared fabrication capability rather than stale Board Setup
via defaults. The public native-import regression was RED before import
synchronization (0.45 mm remained instead of the fixture's 0.30 mm contract),
then GREEN with named power width, assignments, and error severities preserved.
The focused prepared-authority suite separately rejects named-netclass mutation.
It also proves bare standard/advanced tier selection preserves conservative
source Board Setup floors. The live pre-fix driver failed both tier cases; the
corrected driver passes all four focused tests. Initial scratch-import test
runs were discarded and repeated with portable repository imports.

## The principle: test the CHECKERS, not just with them

CLI coverage regressions in `t1_pcb_commission.py`, `t1_project_reports.py` and
`t1_enclosure_layout.py` are RED against 18c96c58: missing denominators, plus
false success over an empty enclosure index. Scaffold counts are checked against
actual files, enclosure counts against all project paths including a misplaced
mesh. `t1_pcba_availability.py` exercises real CLI acceptance and insufficient
stock rejection; these CLI tests satisfy the existing G-RED contract.

`t1_decision_progress.py` covers cumulative investigation budgets, once-only
milestone credit, invalid-model non-credit, stale evidence and handoffs,
pre-launch refusal, and unchanged maturity for ordinary/deferred-work fixtures.
Duplicate YAML history is rejected and real guarded launches reserve durable
spend, block unreported repeats, and avoid charging the later assessment twice.
Ordinary YAML merge overrides retain their meaning; the compatibility fixture
was RED against the first duplicate-key loader and GREEN after its correction.
These tests grade workflow decisions, not electrical correctness. The handoff
regression is RED against pre-integration `pcb_flow.py` (missing decision view).

A gate that cannot fail is worthless. This is not hypothetical — two gates
in this repo were shipping green on real defects when the suite was written:

- **`jlc_twin` exited 0 on 11 unverified parts.** Its fetch classifier
  treated any error message it didn't recognise (an `HTTP Error 403`, a
  traceback) as `NO-CAD` — a *disposition* meaning "the library genuinely
  has no model" — instead of a failure. A part we could not fetch was never
  checked, but the run reported success.
- **`audit_template` printed `AUDIT: PASS` on stacked parts.** Its overlap
  check was bounding-BOX and warn-only, so two footprints occupying the same
  space produced a warning nobody read.

Both are now fixed *and pinned by a known-bad fixture*. The fix without the
fixture would just rot back.

So **every checker gets two kinds of test**:

| kind | asserts |
|---|---|
| `clean` | the checker PASSES a good input |
| `known_bad` | the checker **FAILS** a deliberately broken input |
| `vacuity` | the checker **PASSES** input whose graded fact is FALSE — a *declared blind spot* (canon G-VACUOUS) |

P-PINMAP fixtures cover exact identities, evidenced fused lands, missing and
extra schematic/footprint identities, unexplained aliases, unlike-function
collapses, a zero-denominator run, and the declared consistently-truncated
dossier/schematic/board vacuity. A-RENDER fixtures include the same-camera
bare-image channel, saturated bodies that the old low-saturation heuristic
could not see, leading-zero JLC/KiCad pad-number normalization, and a hard
failure for camera-size mismatch. PR-REVIEW fixtures prove missing, defective,
or hash-stale schematic/placement evidence blocks before routing, plus pin the
declared human-review competence/independence blind spot.

D-SPEC/E-PATH fixtures cover external-output measurement planes and complete
IR paths; E-SWDRV covers controller/MOSFET compatibility; E-SURGE covers
protection coordination. R-PAIRMAP fixtures reject incomplete differential
pair routing contracts before route spend, and R-CRITESC rejects disconnected
or policy-breaking realized copper after stitch.

### The third kind: `vacuity` — a blind spot, pinned on purpose

`known_bad` proves a gate *can* fail. It does not prove the gate can fail **on
the case it exists for**, and six gates were measured green on 2026-07-28/29
with their subject false — `R-LEN` passing cooksense on the word `lengthens` in
a comment about creepage, a `.kicad_dru` barrier rule exempting the very
connector tab it was written for (1.0672 mm against a 6.000 mm constraint),
A-RENDER's verdict resting on 2 of 203 parts, a waiver typed `2.62 mm` that
measures 3.085 mm. See the `G-VACUOUS` row in `design-policies.md`.

So a gate declares its blind spot in **two bound homes**: a `VACUITY:` block in
its module docstring, and

    @test("...", kind="vacuity", gate="<basename>.py")

in `tests/`, which constructs that input and asserts the gate **passes** on it.
`gate_contract_audit.py` fails prose with no fixture, a fixture with no prose,
and a fixture whose *first* assertion is `must_fail` (that would disprove the
blind spot it claims). A declaration without a fixture is worse than none: it
reads as diligence and grades nothing.

Two conventions, both load-bearing:

- **Subject first, then the CONTRAST.** Assert `must_pass` on the blind-spot
  input, *then* `must_fail` on the same input changed in exactly one way. The
  contrast is what distinguishes a blind spot from a fact the gate cannot
  represent at all — every one of the fixtures seeded on 2026-07-29 has one.
- **Closing the blind spot is expected to BREAK the fixture.** That breakage is
  the ratchet, not a regression: convert it to `known_bad`. The runner prints
  these separately, and the count is not a success metric — it is an inventory
  of places a gate is *known* to pass while the fact is false:

      1 DECLARED BLIND SPOT(S) reproduced: a gate passing on input whose
      graded fact is FALSE (G-VACUOUS)

The runner reports them separately and **refuses to report success if zero
known-bad fixtures ran**:

    TOTAL   50 passed, 0 failed, 26 known-bad fixtures made their checker fail

"50 tests pass" means nothing on its own. The second number is the one that
says the gates can still bite.

### Assert PROPERTIES, never file bytes

KRT routing is stochastic and the silk de-collision search is
order-dependent, so golden-file comparison would be permanently broken.
Compare node sets, counts, exit codes, and report substrings — never a hash
of a `.kicad_pcb`. `e2e_boards.py` has an explicit test for this: two runs
must agree on *connectivity*, not on bytes.

### Known-bad fixtures are good inputs broken in exactly ONE way

`harness.edit_board()` mutates a freshly generated board with a pcbnew
snippet; `t1_generate_board.scratch_config()` does the same for a floorplan
YAML. Building the bad case by breaking the good case is what proves the
checker reacts to *that* defect and not to some unrelated malformation.

### A capability that REMOVES something needs a fixture in BOTH polarities

When the fix is "stop keeping X once X is dead", one known-bad is not enough.
The retirement fixture is red against the old code, and a **blanket delete
passes it too** — so the pair is: something dead must be DROPPED, and
something live must be KEPT. Red-verify them against *different* wrong
versions, and say which in the docstring: the drop against the pre-fix code,
the keep against the plausible over-broad fix.

`generate_rules_generic`'s foreign-rule retirement (2026-07-31) is the worked
case. Preservation was one-way, so a `pad_rescue_stubs` sub-floor outlived the
stubs it exempted — but 4 of the fleet's 6 instances were LIVE (377, 44, 41, 5
members), and deleting those re-opens the clean-room 3S stub-floor collision
preservation exists to prevent. `t_foreign_rule_with_members_is_kept` is red
against `members()` stubbed to `return 0`; the two retirement fixtures are red
against the old unconditional comprehension. Each wrong version passes the
other half, which is the point.

## Tiers

**T0 fixtures** (`fixtures/t0/`, seconds) — tiny hand-authored `circuit.json`
inputs. See `fixtures/t0/README.md`.

| fixture | catches |
|---|---|
| `two_resistors` | baseline: sheet is annotated and exports nets at all |
| `polarized` | pad-1 net identity survives conversion (diode/cap orientation) |
| `manypin_custom_fp` | **the `Device:U_chip` collision**: two hand-footprinted chips must export 41 and 24 pins, not 2 each |
| `digit_rails` | leading-digit rail aliasing (`N5V` -> `5V`, `N3V3` -> `3V3`) |
| `label_sides_h` / `label_sides_v` | **label plate DIRECTION**, one 2-pin part placed horizontally and vertically — the plates must reach OUTWARD, clear of the body |

**T1 unit tests** (fast) — one suite per component:

| suite | clean cases | known-bad cases |
|---|---|---|
| `t1_converter.py` | unique lib_symbol per refdes, pins keyed to KiCad pad name, annotated, ERC 0, 41-pin regression, rail canonicalisation, FPID resolution. **LABEL PLATE DIRECTION (2026-07-31)**: a 2-pin part placed horizontally AND vertically has both plates reaching OUTWARD, clear of the body and each other; the `(angle, justify) -> direction` table is RE-MEASURED every run from `kicad-cli sch export svg` INK on a probe sheet (canon M1 — the emitter must not grade its own angles), and every `GND_ANG` rotation is proven to point the ground symbol away from the body; the two fixtures are asserted DISCRIMINATING (plate reach > body span, so the defect is placement-independent) | **a wire root carrying two different LABEL NAMES falls back to `--mode grid`** — the merge happens on LABELS, not pins, and a MID-SEGMENT label was a singleton in the union-find so no guard could see it (smc0985-cooksense: `3V3_ANALOG` mid-segment on a `3V3` wire, 3 segs dropped, SUCCESS declared, 191 nets and no `3V3_ANALOG`; caught only by S-NETMERGE at 161/162). Carries the adjacent-property check that a net's OWN mid-segment label still imports, or every board goes to grid mode; pin-count assertion has teeth, sheet/board parity rejects a mismatch, empty circuit cannot pass parity. **THE LABEL-DIRECTION DEFECT, re-measured every run**: the pre-fix side derivation (`anchor_side` fed straight into the table) fires BOTH plates of a horizontal part across the body, and the LOWER plate of a vertical one — while the UPPER one is correct only by CANCELLATION between that inversion and a `(270, 'left')` table row that renders UP, which is why the two fixes had to land together. Each known-bad asserts INLINE that the defective sheet's netlist is node-for-node identical to the fixed one and its ERC is 0 — the blindness proof, and the reason every connectivity-keyed gate reported green on it. GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED against the real pre-fix file: **19 passed / 5 failed**, exactly the five new fixtures; restored **24 / 0 / 8**. **PROPERTY TEXT vs THE GROUND GLYPH OF ITS OWN PIN (2026-07-31)**: the `Reference`/`Value` rows were a BLIND offset from the body edge (`iy -/+ h/2 -/+ 2.2`), so on a VERTICALLY placed 2-pin passive the Value was written into the exact strip the bottom pin's ground triangle occupies — 160 of the fleet's 341 S-OCCL findings and 7 of the 11 blocking pluto-rx2-8way-v2. All four (orientation x grounded pin) cases are FALSIFIED IN RENDERED INK, not against a model: KiCad renders the fixture and no graphic stroke may pass through a property's glyph run. The known-bad re-runs the pre-fix rows every run and reports HONESTLY that only the two VERTICAL cases go red — the horizontal pair is the ADJACENT PROPERTY (a sideways triangle spans +-1.00 mm across its axis against a >= 2.797 mm Value offset, a gap no box height can close), and 0 of 166 grounded horizontal passives in the real fleet move. `sym_xf` and `glyph_box` are re-measured from `kicad-cli sch export svg` INK every run with an ASYMMETRIC probe rect (canon M1) — that measurement is also what caught three shapes of KiCad ink a `<path d=` matcher silently drops, one of them the ground triangle itself. GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED against `2914dcad`: **25 passed / 3 failed**, restored **28 / 0 / 9**. **LABEL DE-COLLISION (2026-07-31, canon S11)**: after the direction and property fixes, ALL 182 remaining S-OCCL findings on the fleet had a `global_label` as one member (77 label-vs-pin, 42 label-vs-Reference, 32 label-vs-label, 16 label-vs-glyph, 8 label-vs-body, 7 label-vs-Value, nothing else) — plates were emitted where tscircuit's anchor put them and never checked against what they landed on. Two labels colliding are separated on BOTH axes, each asserted in RENDERED INK on the GLYPH RUNS a human actually reads (not on plate rectangles, and not on coordinates); the RED side holds `place_labels` off, which is exactly the pre-pass converter. **The plate model had to be re-measured first and it is the THIRD inherited constant found wrong**: the shipped `(len + 2) * CH_W` treats every character as 1.05 mm wide while KiCad's stroke font is PROPORTIONAL — 95 characters measured out of rendered ink give an exact k/21 of the font size, k from 8 (`` ` ``) to 28 (`m`), so the flat model runs 0.77 mm too WIDE for `IIII` and **6.48 mm too NARROW** for a 20-character name of capitals. Too narrow is the dangerous direction: a search built on it places plates it calls clear and KiCad draws through their neighbours. `PLATE_BASE` (1.3341 mm) and `PLATE_CROSS` (2.5408 mm) both measure with ZERO spread and are asserted as SETS so the zero spread cannot be averaged away, and the model is asserted an UPPER bound on ink for every one of the 190 probe plates. The contact threshold is measured too, not copied: every plate-vs-anything overlap over the six layout sheets is 108 at exactly zero, 205 at exactly 0.0004/0.0008 mm (the 2.5408 mm plate against the 2.540 mm pin pitch — arithmetic, not crowding), then NOTHING until 0.0677 mm, so the threshold sits in the empty two-decade gap. **THE ADJACENT-PROPERTY CONTROL FOUND A SHIPPED FIXTURE DIRTY**: `label_sides_h` and `two_resistors` come out byte-identical (UUID-normalised) with the pass on and off, but `label_sides_v` MOVES — its two vertical plates run through its own Reference and Value, which are centred on the same x, and `t_label_sides_vertical` never saw it because that test grades plate-vs-body and plate-vs-plate only. It is now asserted in ink in both directions, and `sch_occlusion.py` (which this suite does not own) independently reads that fixture 2 -> 0. **The hard-error case** proves an unplaceable label exits **3** naming the label, with `LABEL PLACEMENT FAILED`, writing no sheet and NOT falling back to `--mode grid` — plus the adjacent property that removing the one blocking component makes the same label placeable. **The interaction fixture is the uncomfortable one**: run the pass over the PRE-FIX direction defect and it HIDES it — the sheet comes out with zero collisions while every plate still points at the wrong pin — so a green S-OCCL is not evidence that labels point the right way, and the two PRE-FIX direction fixtures hold the pass off deliberately. GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED against `HEAD`: **28 passed / 8 failed**, exactly the eight new fixtures and nothing else; restored **36 / 0 / 13** |
| `t1_occlusion.py` | S-OCCL geometry (`sch_occlusion.py`). **THE WHOLE KiCad TABLE IS RE-MEASURED FROM RENDERED INK EVERY RUN** (canon M1): all 8 `(angle, justify)` plate directions plus the 4 no-`justify` defaults, the symbol rotation transform checked with an ASYMMETRIC probe rectangle so a wrong handedness cannot pass, all 4 `elt:GND` rotations, and the plate's CROSS extent against the model's constant. Findings are FALSIFIED against KiCad's own render — a label's plate is a 6-point polyline, a property a `stroked-text` run — so a reported pair must really overlap in ink. Attachment is not occlusion (a plate ending on the pin tip it hangs off passes; the same plate laid ALONG the pin fails). The fleet is graded with a full denominator and the two `--mode grid` boards must stay at 0 | **FOUR AXES IN TWO SHAPES EACH, and the RED side is the REAL PRE-FIX BYTES**: `prefix()` extracts the `if ang == 180: … else: +x` block from `git show 948ef54d:policy_audit.py` and RUNS it on every fixture, every run. A plate fired LEFT / RIGHT / UP / DOWN into a symbol body FAILS while the pre-fix model returns `[]` for all four (it had no bodies at all); and two plates overlapping along each of the four axes FAIL **with no symbol on the sheet**, so that half turns purely on DIRECTION — the pre-fix model misses those because it points the plate the wrong way (`(0,'right')` reaches LEFT, `(90|270, *)` are the whole vertical axis, and it read `justify` nowhere). Plus: an object the model cannot PLACE is a FAIL naming it, never a pass (an unmodelled label angle, a local label). **1 declared vacuity**: pin NAME/NUMBER text is not placed, and the fixture RENDERS the sheet to prove KiCad's pin-number ink really sits inside the plate box it just passed, then FAILS the same plate moved onto the pin LINE |
| `t1_generate_board.py` | parts land per config, anchors unmoved, F.Fab copies, parity 0, source identity fields (including escaped supplier JSON) survive a generated-board save/reopen while legacy parts retain absent fields, board-level via capping/filling survives a pcbnew save round-trip | **missing FPID = hard error**, unknown footprint, violated polarity assert, over-subscribed floorplan, unknown zone net, invalid via-protection value |
| `t1_connector_qualification_coupon.py` | the exact carrier source produces a connector-only, full-outline, same-layer-count/thickness coupon with 11 connector refs, 7 board datums, zero connected pads, clean fabrication exports, and a 20/20 evidence response regrades and reopens PASS | an unfilled response remains typed INCOMPLETE, and moving one connector fails normalized geometry even after the changed board byte bindings are refreshed |
| `t1_audit.py` | audit_template / audit_board / parity pass a clean board, policy_audit P-SILK-REF passes, M-REL grades a per-board-named release and sorts v1.10 above v1.9 | **courtyard overlap FAILS**, **refdes-on-F.Fab-only FAILS**, pad off-board, missing GND pour, stranded decoupler, renamed net, deleted part, **policy_audit P-SILK-REF FAILS** on an F.Fab-only board, **M-REL reaches into the SIBLING BOARD's release series** (the cooksense/interposer shape — pre-fix it demands `SUPERSEDED.md` on the LIVE cooksense-v1.4), **an UNATTRIBUTABLE release set is a FAIL naming the directory, and M-BOM/A-POP/A-BODY fail with it** (pre-fix: `| M-REL | PASS |` over a release it could not attribute) |
| `t1_placement_gates.py` | the three current boards pass as placed, synthetic two-cluster board with a wide corridor passes, P-CAP waiver with evidence, P-OUT `out_ok` ref waiver | **P-OUT fails a pad outside an L-shaped outline that audit_template I1's RECTANGLE check provably cannot see**, **P-CAP fails a pinched 1.2mm corridor (10 nets vs ~6 slots; red-verified inline with the keepout blockage disabled)**, **the HISTORICAL cooksense pre-REDO board (18392f2, the 13h D-BACK) fails both gates**, waiver without evidence, missing Edge.Cuts is a FAIL not a skip |
| `t1_release_index.py` | numeric-per-component version order, both shipped name shapes parse (incl. a board whose own name ends in `-v2`), `04_kicad` underscores and release-dir hyphens are one board, **the REAL cooksense tree resolves to cooksense-v1.4 and not the last directory**, all 9 projects resolve with a denominator | **THE PRE-FIX SELECTOR, run against the real sealed tree, returns `interposer-v1.0` while the board graded is `cooksense` — the red side is MEASURED on every run, not asserted in a docstring** (4 SUPERSEDED demands pre-fix incl. the live release, 3 post-fix, all 3 of which have the file); 'the latest' with no board named on a two-board project REFUSES; a prefix naming a board the project does not build REFUSES; a bare `v1.0-<date>` in a two-board project REFUSES; a directory that is not a release at all REFUSES |
| `t1_release_freshness.py` | the four earlier supersede modes, plus **`--sourcing-supersede`** (canon M8): a part substitution whose MPN+LCSC move on one row and whose `.tsx` moves with it PASSES, and the real sealed usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.11 passes against v1.10; plus **`--value-change-supersede`**: a re-valued 22k pair whose CPL delta is 2 `Val` cells and whose BOM delta is the 2 DECLARED refs PASSES, and the five earlier modes are each shown to still refuse that same tree | **13 known-bad on the sourcing mode alone** — a changed Footprint, a dropped row, a REORDERED designator list, a blanked MPN, a BOM that moved with no `.tsx` change (the HAND-EDITED class, canon M3), an UNDOCUMENTED substitution (neither code in MANIFEST/README), a moved CPL, a changed board md5, a changed gerber **while the same test proves a RE-PLOT of the same copper is still accepted** (a strip list too wide is as wrong as one too narrow), a supersede that substitutes nothing, an MPN-only edit (that is `--legible-bom`'s job), an added fab file, and a BOM failing F-LEGIBLE. GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED: pre-fix **0 passed / 14 failed**, post-fix **14 / 0 / 13 known-bad**. **17 more on the value-change mode** — the three headline ones (a moved CPL COORDINATE, a BOM edit on an UNDECLARED designator, a CHANGED GERBER) each carry an inline ADJACENT-PROPERTY red-verify: the same tree with that one property RESTORED must PASS, re-measured every run, because a git-swap red on a brand-new flag proves only that the flag is new. Plus a moved rotation, an undeclared `Val` move, a HAND-EDITED CSV (no source moved, canon M3), a board edited without its schematic (the shortcut that leaves `--schematic-parity` reporting `footprint_symbol_mismatch`), a new Comment against the OLD part's LCSC (**the R12/R30 wrong-part class**), BOM and CPL DISAGREEING about the new value (they come from one `fp.GetValue()` call), a changed Footprint, a designator list WIDER than the real delta, a supersede that re-values nothing, a dropped BOM ref, an undocumented change, an added fab file, a non-authoring `source/` change, and a run with no `--designators` at all. GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED 2026-07-28: pre-fix **0 passed / 18 failed / 0 known-bad**, post-fix **18 / 0 / 17**; whole file 56/18/41 -> 74/0/58. HARNESS INTEGRITY re-measured on the new suite (the commit-`0dd56ab` class, where the runner could exit 0 while reporting failures): breaking one new assertion makes `run_tests.sh --only=value-change` print `17 passed, 1 failed` / `FAILURES PRESENT` and **exit 1** |
| `t1_publication_gate.py` | semantic diff selection, the real sealed/reviewed Pluto RX2 v4 release passes, and all four exact-artifact review/archive bindings pass | **the real DRC/parity-green but unsealed programmable USB hub is refused**, and a review bound to adjacent board bytes plus absent from `08_reviews/` is refused |

| `t1_status.py` | **the beacon reader** (`pcb_status.py`): fresh/live-pid/done/blocked boards are not STALLED, multi-board `STATUS-<board>.md` scoping. **The beacon GATE** (`status_beacon_check.py`, canon M-BEACON): a beacon naming the LIVE release against the REAL sealed release set passes; the fleet is graded with a full `N/M` denominator (asserted; the VERDICT deliberately is not — see below) | STALLED detection + the age test RED-verified against a classifier that drops it. **The known-bads are REAL DRIFTED BEACONS, verbatim at 98f4c3a** (`fixtures/beacons/`, PROVENANCE.md): **`M-BEACON-DUP` on the file that had v1.2's frame APPENDED under v1.1's** (4 duplicated fields; the reader rendered `sealed / done` over a SUPERSEDED release), **`M-BEACON-REL` naming v1.2 while v1.3 is live**, **`M-BEACON-AGE` predating that seal**, **`M-BEACON-FIELD` on the cooksense beacon with no `step:`/`op_pid:`/`updated:` at all**, AGE biting ALONE on a beacon broken in exactly one way, a zero denominator, and **the mtime ADJACENT-PROPERTY red-verify** — the fixture's file is seconds old and still stale, same input opposite verdict. Measured when the gate landed: 13 findings across 4 of 6 fleet beacons. **usb-hub-3s-v3 is deliberately NOT asserted**: its beacon was left drifted while its v1.11 seal ran elsewhere, to test on a live seal whether the RITUAL refreshes it |

| `t1_escape_tier.py` | escape_check calibration matches shipped ground truth, P-ESC+P-TIER pass an agreeing part, the proven-parts ledger parses and every `` see `x` `` cross-reference RESOLVES, P-ADJ-UNREACHED passes when every keep_short budget resolves | **the incident config FAILS P-TIER (0.5mm QFN @ standard)**, tampered block, style lie, missing block, tier typo, unescapable package; **S-VER now reads the KEY, not the first place the word appears** — a citation hidden behind a `# ... verified: figure 3` COMMENT FAILS, and so does one the 300-char window rescued by matching `p 4` out of a PPTC's `Itrip 4A` three keys later (the real MF-MSMF200L-2; 15 of 557 fleet part.yaml had grep-vs-key disagreement); **P-ADJ-UNREACHED** FAILS a keep_short budget whose net has <2 pads, naming the net (**61 of 119 fleet budgets, 51%, were graded by NOTHING**) — a SEPARATE ID so the two existing P-ADJ span waivers cannot absorb it, proven by making the two verdicts disagree; **the proven-parts validator BITES** — six mutations of the shipped ledger each produce their own finding |
| `t1_module_first.py` | P-MOD accepts a dossier-proven module, permits an evidenced bare-IC D-MOD exception, accepts an explicit passive-board denominator, and proves both new-project rebuild templates invoke it before schematic generation | **unexplained bare MCU**, a bare package falsely labelled as a module, thin comparison evidence, an omitted complex subsystem, and missing adoption all fail distinctly; one bounded vacuity fixture records the custom/unrecognized `type:` blind spot |
| `t1_rules_bom.py` | netclasses + widths reach `.kicad_pro` and `.kicad_dru`, rules_audit passes; **the source phase grades every authored class before KiCad artifacts exist**; **a preserved rule the emitter cannot fully evaluate is KEPT and says NOT DERIVABLE** (retirement requires a positively derived zero, so under-retiring is the failure mode) | **source phase refuses an unreadable current declaration**, full phase still refuses missing generated artifacts, **ampacity floor** violated, `.kicad_pro`/`.kicad_dru` disagree, unpatterned net, generate_rules never ran, **unmapped BOM line**, missing BOM, **a genuine second .kicad_pro still aborts (kicad-cli-dropping purge scoped)**; **FOREIGN-RULE RETIREMENT IN BOTH POLARITIES (2026-07-31)** — a `pad_rescue_stubs` rule whose rule area survives on the board but is EMPTY, and one whose area is gone entirely, must both be DROPPED with their 0-member count printed (red against the old one-way `foreign_dru_rules` comprehension), while one whose area still wraps real copper must be KEPT (red against `dru_subject.members` stubbed to `return 0` — the blanket delete that would have dropped four live fleet exemptions at 377/44/41/5 members) |
| `t1_promoted_route.py` | P-ROUTEBASE accepts matching placement/source vias and fresh deterministic prep copper | refuses prepared segment/via loss, footprint movement, source-via geometry/process drift, and added/removed source vias before human placement review |
| `t1_via_ampacity.py` | A-VIA credits named tight series-transition banks from an explicit finished-hole current table; absence is explicit N-A | insufficient parallel barrels fail; declared vacuity fixture proves a geometrically counted same-net via need not carry the series current |
| `t1_via_process.py` | exact-board V-FLAGS/V-SELECT census accepts drill-disjoint protected Type-VII and ordinary via families and reproduces the generated order note | malformed/mixed process selections and incomplete order instructions fail |
| `t1_rebuild_templates.py` | rebuild_reuse.sh template: bash -n, DRC gate carries all three flags on one invocation, generate_rules before import AND last after stitch, pinned sch copied before DRC, no tsci, board name derived from config. **M-FRESH (canon, 2026-07-30)**: every `circuit.json` `rebuild_all.sh` GRADES is one it WRITES from `dist/`, and the driver STAMPS before `tsci build` and VERIFIES between the build and the converter; `build_provenance.py` passes when the converter input IS the builder's output. **The `rebuild_all.sh` ERC gate blocks on ERRORS** (`--severity-error --exit-code-violations`) **while still recording the full-severity baseline**, and **the per-board `audit_board.py` call is GUARDED with a speaking `else`** | **ordering assertion rejects rules-before-stitch**, **DRC-flag assertion rejects a dropped --schematic-parity**; **the PRE-FIX TEMPLATE (`git show e50be3f`) is rejected by the wiring check** (measured: 17 passed / 3 failed, `consumed=['03_tscircuit/build/circuit.json'] produced=[]`); **THE INCIDENT ITSELF — `build/circuit.json` holds an obsolete pad-numbering scheme, `tsci build` writes the corrected one to `dist/src/<TSX>/`, the converter is handed `build/`** and F-PATH fires, with the fixture asserting inline that the stale bytes are VALID json (which is why nine parser-shaped checkers passed them); **a `touch` on the stale file cannot forge freshness** — and that fixture is the only one that catches the plausible wrong implementation (measured: swapping the sha256 equality for `artifact newer than producer` leaves the incident test PASSING at 19/1); F-VOID on a build that wrote nothing, **F-KNOB on the `BOARD=power3s` shape caught at `stamp`, i.e. BEFORE the build**, F-NORUN on a board whose driver never completed a run, F-STALE once the tscircuit sources move past the last verified build, the audit's UNREACHED/OWED/FAIL trichotomy never rendering as a pass (M-COVER), and F-KNOB still biting on a driver that never adopted the stamp (the ratchet is not an amnesty). Five mutations RED-VERIFIED, each isolating exactly one fixture. **Two TEMPLATE defects the board fixed only in its own copy, 2026-07-30**: the ERC line gated on WARNINGS (`--severity-all --exit-code-violations`) — MEASURED, pluto-rx2-8way-v2 failed its own driver at **exit 5 on 220 cosmetic findings with 0 errors** — and `03_src/audit_board.py` was called UNCONDITIONALLY, aborting every zero-bespoke-Python board at `set -e`. Both are refused in BOTH directions: a non-blocking ERC stage and a dropped full-severity baseline are rejected alongside the warning-gate, and a bare `if [ -f ]` with no speaking `else` is rejected alongside the unconditional call (a board that LOST its audit script must not read as one that passed it — M-COVER in a driver). GIT-SWAP RED-VERIFIED against the real pre-fix template (`git show 982858d8`): **20 passed / 4 failed**, exactly the four new fixtures and nothing else; restored **24 / 0** |
| `t1_jlc_twin.py` | affirmative NO-CAD does not block, cache replays without the network, empty BOM announces it checked nothing, **`xform()` reproduces pcbnew's OWN pad placement exactly** (and the fixture is required to be able to tell the two handednesses apart), `--assembly` reads the coded not-assembled/consigned pairs from the declared home (`--also` still works) | **HTTP 403 = FETCH-FAILED + exit 1**, fetcher crash blocks, timeout blocks, nonzero importer exit alone is never NO-CAD (only an exact fresh independently recorded catalog absence response can establish absence afterward), **the fitted `jlc_offset` has the correct handedness (both directions; RED-verified — the pre-fix form returns every 90/270 part 180° off)** |
| `t1_assembly_gates.py` | A-POP passes a fully declared release; **the pcbnew-free board reader agrees with pcbnew on a real sealed board, 195/195, 0 mismatches** (the canon-M1 independence claim is MEASURED, not asserted); A-STOCK passes a parseable PASS verdict, honours the `--json` sidecar, lets a `sourcing_plan` entry clear a line, and says out loud when there is nothing to grade | **cooksense v1.1 FAILS naming all 13 blank-LCSC refs on its CPL**, the interposer v1.0 FAILS (uncoded on CPL + no assembly.yaml + no MANIFEST line), crow-rv2 v1.3 FAILS (its PLACED consigned U1 declared not_assembled), **one extra `exclude_from_pos_files` FAILS naming only that ref**, entry without evidence, reason outside the vocabulary, consign-as-unpopulated, declared-but-not-excluded, MANIFEST drift; **crow-rv2 v1.3 FAILS A-STOCK (its own CPU at `LOW_STOCK(0)`)**, **cooksense v1.1 FAILS with a DISTINCT no-parseable-verdict finding**, **deleting the verdict from PASSING evidence still FAILS**, ungraded line, no evidence at all, verdict-less `--json`, incomplete `sourcing_plan` |
| `t1_net_label_survival.py` | label survival passes an intact netlist, pin_map with `{n}` substitution, evidenced exemption, template rebuild_all wires the semantic battery in canonical order (tsx_preflight BEFORE tsci build; battery right after netlist export) | **the P5VA_4→AUDIO4M merged-label netlist FAILS (LABEL-LOST)**, **a misplanted port pin FAILS (PIN-MAP)**, wired NC pin, exemption without `why:` = config error, zero-net netlist = hard error, **the template battery aborts on a violated invariant with its named GATE FAILED line** |
| `t1_import_provenance.py` | the REAL pluto-cal-switch `mates.yaml` graded against the REAL `external_hardware/plutoplus_hardware/` record (15/15 facts, both disagreeing units consumed), the explicit registry-root override, a clean synthetic tree, a board that mates to nothing **saying NOTHING TO GRADE instead of PASS**, a BRIEF that declines to mate, and the gate obeying G-INPUT/G-COVER/G-RED | **the PRE-CALIPER PlutoPlus span as the headline: 35.60 mm ESTIMATED with no bar, spent on a dimension (M-BAR), and the same number graded MEASURED because three extractions agreed to 0.003 mm (M-PROXY)** — both RED-verified by neutering the check (18/2 and 19/1); plus an unparseable bar, a missing grade, an invented grade, an unknown id, **facts.yaml DRIFTED from the record it indexes**, a missing device folder, the retired `spf/` authority path, unparseable yaml, an OWED fact spent dimensionally, OWED with no route, a board RESTATING a value, a consumption with no site, a BRIEF lock with no yaml, and an empty `consumes:` (M-COVER) |
| `t1_tsx_to_board.py` | generic fall-through when `generate_board.py` is absent (ADR-0002 amendment), board name from `floorplan.yaml`, bespoke priority + unchanged legacy path | **no backend at all = FATAL naming BOTH options** (all five red-verified vs the pre-retrofit driver, incl. its latent silent-exit-on-missing-tsx bug) |
| `t1_copper_length.py` | REALIZED COPPER LENGTH (canon R-LEN). A genuinely matched pair PASSES at spread 0.0000 mm; a member is an ORDERED NET CHAIN so 8+12 and 12+8 both measure 20.000 mm; an ARC is r*theta and not its chord; a via barrel is priced at 1.1896 mm from a DECLARED `stackup_mm`; the phase conversion prints (6.105 ps/mm, 13.19 deg/mm, both re-derived from the ordered stackup and corroborating the two boards' ADRs within 2%); and **the pcbnew-free reader AGREES WITH `PCB_TRACK.GetLength()` on four real routed boards — 351 nets, 0 disagreements above 1 um** (the canon-M1 independence claim is MEASURED, since pcbnew generated and imported this copper). The census reproduces the fleet's ONE honest bespoke length check, crow-recorder-central-v2's USB pair, at 23.6209 / 23.5110 mm, spread 0.1099 mm — canon M8's second strike, and the reason its 3-component/0-branch topology must NOT fail. | **THE HEADLINE IS THE VACUITY ITSELF, RE-MEASURED EVERY RUN: the PRE-FIX R-LEN predicate is RUN against smc0985-cooksense's REAL `audit_board.py` and PASSES on two CREEPAGE COMMENTS**, and passes a file whose entire content is `# the slot is length-adjusted` — while the new gate on the same tree says N-A with a zero denominator and never prints `PASS`. Plus: two arms 1.5 mm apart FAIL naming 19.79 deg at 6 GHz; **the PIN bites where the ceiling does not** (0.6 mm spread inside a 1.0 mm ceiling but off a published 0.0 +-0.05 mm — the two verdicts disagree on purpose, because a re-route silently turns published picoseconds into fiction); ONE VIA on ONE arm FAILS `no_vias` (the only place that ban is graded anywhere — nothing in the router enforces it); THREE separate UNREACHED reasons each asserted alone (a ZONE, a via with no stackup, a BRANCH) and none may render as PASS, with `--strict` making the coverage gap exit 1; an UNROUTED board is UNREACHED WITH ITS COUNT naming every net (**which is exactly what both pluto boards report today**); a spread with no `congruent_pads:` claim is printed and NOT graded; seven malformed declarations exit 2 UNGRADED; a TRUNCATED `(segment)` exits 2 rather than under-reporting copper; and E-NETREF grades the declaration where it ENTERS as kind **K12**, with an inline adjacent-property re-verify that the same block with the typo FIXED resolves. |
| `t1_bom_legibility.py` | the MPN authority prefers a dossier's `mpn:` FIELD over its directory name (the `/` in `LM5116MHX/NOPB`), F-WORDS refuses exactly three shapes and accepts real part names, **F-ENCODE is indifferent between a UTF-8 BOM marker and ASCII `Ohm`**, the exporter's own output passes the INDEPENDENT checker at F-MPN 46/46 and ships a BOM marker, the escape hatch is loud, the F-ECHO worklist is written, a clean echo passes | **the SEALED crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.5 BOM — the one JLC could not process — FAILS all three checks**, **a sealed BOM with NO MPN COLUMN is a FAIL not a skip** (usb-hub-3s v1.0; its 48 rows were excluded from ADR-0006's own 914/1205 denominator), **the two match paths DISAGREE on usb-hub-3s-v3 SW1** (`SS12D07VG6 087` vs the dossier's `SS12D07VG6-087` — the retired side-file's drift, which a blank-only check would pass), zero data rows, an unresolvable code, **F-ECHO catches the C82317 -> C131025 substitution** and a zero-overlap table, **the exporter BLOCKS the incident board and leaves nothing uploadable** (all 5 exporter tests red-verified against the pre-ADR-0006 exporter), **25 of 26 sealed BOMs fail** |

| `t1_trace_audit.py` | **OBSERVED GRADING (canon GG-SHADOW / GG-RESOLVE)**: the canary's three hand-written gates report exactly what a human wrote down IN THIS FILE (the expectations live in the SUITE, never in the auditor — canon M1), and `clean_gate.py` yielding NOTHING is the negative control that stops an analyser which returns a finding unconditionally; the tracer is TRANSPARENT (a real gate's stdout and exit code are byte-identical with and without it, **and a trace file must have been written**, or the test would be vacuous); reads and probes are separate channels and are never summed; a gate's own exhaust is subtracted whether it was WRITTEN or merely BORN during the run; the battery roster is DERIVED from three properties (project arg + prints a verdict + no socket) and the verdict detector is IMPORTED from `gate_contract_audit`, never re-implemented; **EVERY EXIT CODE IN THE LEGEND IS REACHED BY A REAL RUN** (round 1 declared 3 and 4 and emitted them from nowhere — dead vocabulary reads as a capability); and **every emitted GG-* id has a canon row AND every canon GG-* row has an emitter**, with the six withdrawn families pinned absent from BOTH halves. | **THE HEADLINE IS THE CONTROL THAT STOPPED THE LAYER, RE-RUN EVERY TIME**: two identical genuinely-blind subjects differing by ONE FILE — `06_build/policy_audit.md`, a battery gate's own output — give rc 0 and rc 3, and the rc-0 run must carry the exhaust caveat and must NOT contain the withdrawn certification in any of its three spellings. Plus: a planted unread twin fires EXACTLY ONCE and the same trace is silent without it; a SELECTION fires where an ENUMERATION is silent; a bad `--root` is exit 2 and an empty read set is exit 3 (never a pass); a blinded tracer is exit 5, never 0; a subject-less run is an INVOCATION error rather than a green that says nothing. **FIVE RED-VERIFICATIONS MEASURED ON EVERY RUN, not asserted in a docstring**: a copy of `gradelib/` with the stat family removed makes GG-RESOLVE go silent on its own canary WHILE GG-SHADOW KEEPS FIRING (so the fixture cannot pass by simply breaking the copy); `.md` put back into GG-SHADOW's scope makes the `01_docs/journal` vs `01_docs/learnings` false positive RETURN; a post-battery basename index MANUFACTURES a finding a pre-battery one does not; the pre-fix `short()` is re-introduced and measured DIVERGING between the sandbox and in-place modes on a symlink; and **the pre-fix PER-TRACE read-set is re-introduced and measured producing 2 FALSE findings** where the fleet union produces none. **THE DISPATCHER FIXTURE (`tests/fixtures/gg_dispatch/`)**: a gate that spawns one worker SUBPROCESS per board and its semantically identical in-process twin have the PROVABLY IDENTICAL 2-file read-set, and pre-fix gave RAW EXIT 1 with 2 false findings against RAW EXIT 0 with none — the verdict was a function of the gate's PROCESS TOPOLOGY. That matters for sequencing: the per-board path resolution owed for ADR-0007 is naturally a dispatcher, so pre-fix the FIX for the defect GG-SHADOW finds would have MADE GG-SHADOW FIRE. **`truncated` HAS A CONSUMER**: a trace that hit `GRADELIB_MAX_EVENTS` is exit 5 and carries no verdict, both arms (canary and battery) measured, because a PREFIX of the read-set cannot support "nothing opened this file" and therefore manufactures FALSE findings. **One DECLARED BLIND SPOT (G-VACUOUS), NOW WITH BOTH ARMS**: the gate exits 0 over a battery that saw only `06_build/policy_audit.md` (a gate's own output) AND over one that saw only `01_docs/BRIEF.md` (three lines of prose, nobody's output, graded by nothing) — so the true statement is ANY pre-existing file ANY gate happens to open, and the OWED identity test closes the first arm only. |

**T2 integration tests** (`t2_route_stitch.py`, fast + `--slow` e2e) — the
generic router/stitcher (`route_and_stitch_generic.py`). Route-prep, the KRT
command line (driven by a hermetic stub router), import, and the stitch pass
ordering. KRT is stochastic, so every assertion is a PROPERTY — argv, pass
order, node sets, exit codes — never bytes.

| suite | clean cases | known-bad cases |
|---|---|---|
| `t2_route_stitch.py` | prep writes a track-free r0 with per-layer keepouts + wave lists, the KRT command line carries geometry/keepout/per-wave overrides, waves are chained rN→rN+1, a wave with no track_width derives it from the netclass floor, `quick` passes a routed board with the routed/deferred split, stitch runs the configured pass order, stitch preserves connectivity, two runs agree on connectivity, a removal pass triggers a SWIG barrier, `fresh_reload` unconditionally rebuilds post-fill connectivity, verified A* supports one/two reviewed layers and propagates strict hole-to-copper checks, heal_islands bridges a split same-net pour (2 groups → 1, net-class width, kicad-cli-DRC-verified), heal_islands via-hops through a shared plane when every same-layer gap is blocked, heal_islands never bridges different nets (red-verified with the net guard disabled), heal_islands is idempotent (red-verified with island-seating disabled), island seating uses exact via-ring and flashed-pad copper overlap at a fill boundary (both centre-only regressions RED-verified while distant copper remains unseated), **`stitch_grid` honours a FRACTIONAL pitch** — asserted as a LATTICE property, not a via count, since collision survival is board-dependent (RED-verified against the `range(int(...))` stepper: **128 of 144 vias off the declared 1.5 mm lattice**; blast radius measured over all 13 repo configs first — 0 fractional, 0 lattices moved, so the mid-seal cooksense was provably untouched) | **tracked route input rejected**, **netclass-less project rejected (canon R1)**, **unknown wave net**, **a wave below its class floor fails prep**, **quick catches a planted open + a planted sub-floor track**, **KRT nonzero exit blocks**, **KRT silent no-output caught**, **double-import rejected**, **missing chain file**, **unknown stitch pass**, **no-`fill` pass list**, **unknown KRT flag**, **stitch-grid minimum bites**, **a NON-POSITIVE stitch pitch is a hard error** (pre-fix `range(a,b,-2)` yielded nothing and the run printed `stitch grid: 0 vias` / `filled 2 zones` / `gate: clean` — a board with NO return-path stitching, gated green, from a config that asked for a grid), **pad-rescue `require:all` bites**, **power-stitch minimum bites**, **a failed gate leaves no stale resume marker**, **a heal with NO legal bridge is a hard error, never a violating bridge (red-verified with the collision check disabled)**, **heal_islands refuses to run before fill** |
| `t2_grind.py` | grind_driver auto-fixes a batch class to 0/0/0 with M9 journal entries per cycle, same-net zone<->zone splits classify as the auto `unconnected_zone_islands` (heal_islands rerun) while pad<->zone stays escalate | **a never-improving board escalates D-BACK within 3 cycles (the driver is UNABLE to loop forever)**, **a novel class escalates immediately with no fix attempt**, **table-escalate classes stop the loop with the compact report**, **--max-cycles caps even an improving run** |
| `t2_pcb_flow.py` | compact schema-2 handoff binds source/board/tool/gate evidence, YAML formatting does not perturb semantic hashes, legacy state is explicit, timed commands preserve command-vs-budget status, fresh-board P-LAND follows rebuild, successful seal is transactional, multi-board inputs/packages/state remain isolated | **changed source, board, tool, and gate independently stale the handoff**, **a gate older than its board cannot be published**, **dirty/unwitnessed DRC cannot claim layout_sealed**, **handoff failure leaves no seal**, **ambiguous/unscoped multi-board config and oversized handoffs fail**, **deterministic/stochastic ownership cannot overlap**, **budget regression returns exit 6 while preserving command result** |

**T4 regression corpus** (`t4_regressions.py`, fast) — one named test per
incident this project has already paid for, so none can silently return.
Every test names the defect, its DATE, and the commit or doc that records it.

It pinned NOTHING, so `t1_layout_precedent.py`, created three days later at `bcec2fd6`, carried the bug straight back in and hid its own `PREC_GRADED_FLOOR` ratchet failure. **Second, independent instance in the runner:** `rc` came from each suite's EXIT STATUS while `TF` came from a STDOUT grep, and only `rc` was read — so the two channels could disagree and the printed verdict was the wrong one | 2026-07-27 `0dd56ab0` → 2026-07-30 `bcec2fd6` | `t4_regressions.t_every_suite_propagates_and_is_wired_in` — **executes each suite's `__main__` block with `main` stubbed to return 1** and asserts the SystemExit code, so it grades the PROPERTY (exit-code propagation), not the string `sys.exit(main())` that `0dd56ab0`'s own sweep false-positived `t3_acceptance.py` on. Same sweep asserts every `t*.py` on disk is WIRED INTO `run_tests.sh` (**measured: `t1_release_required.py` — A-EVID, 6 tests, 4 known-bad — had never once run**). Known-bad sibling `t_exit_code_guard_bites_a_bare_main` keeps the sweep from becoming a gate that cannot fail once the tree is clean. `run_tests.sh` now fails on EITHER channel and names the disagreement. **RED-VERIFIED both halves on the real defect**: the sweep, run before the one-line repair, printed `['t1_layout_precedent.py']`; and on that same tree the **pre-fix runner printed `1 failed` AND `ALL SUITES PASSED` and exited 0**, where the fixed one prints `FAILED: HARNESS DISAGREEMENT` and exits 1 |

Two things this file does that the T1 tiers do not:

* **Verified red against pre-fix code.** Where the fix lives in current code,
  the old version was swapped back in and the test confirmed to FAIL. The
  test comment records it. Eight were verified this way; the ones that could
  not be are named below.
* **Says so when it cannot reproduce.** Three incidents are recorded as NOT
  REPRODUCED at the top of `t4_regressions.py` rather than covered by a test
  that passes vacuously — most importantly, the `.kicad_pro` clobber itself
  does not reproduce on this KiCad build, so what is pinned is the ordering
  contract the clobber forced, not the clobber.

**E2E** (`--slow`) — regenerate cook-loadcell and crow-array-pod with the
generic generator and assert netlist parity 0 against the sealed boards plus
`audit_board` PASS. `t2_route_stitch.py` adds the routing half: both boards
run generate → rules → prep → **real KRT** → import → stitch → rules-last →
DRC, and must reach 0 violations / 0 unconnected / 0 parity (cook-loadcell
also re-checks netlist parity 0 vs the sealed board). KRT is stochastic, so
this asserts the 0/0/0 PROPERTY across a fresh route, not a golden board.

**Live network** (`--net`) — opt-in only, never in CI-by-default. No such
suite ships today; add it as `net_live.py` if you need a real EasyEDA fetch.

---

## How the network is mocked

`jlc_twin` shells out to `easyeda2kicad`, which is a complete and
deterministic seam — no HTTP interception needed.

- **Failure injection**: `stub_e2k()` writes a fake fetcher binary and points
  `$EASYEDA2KICAD` at it. It can print any message and exit any code.
- **Replay**: `fetch()` returns early when
  `OUTDIR/easyeda/<LCSC>/jlc.pretty/*.kicad_mod` is non-empty, so the
  per-code cache dir *is* the fixture store. Seed it and the fetcher is never
  invoked — `t_cache_replay` proves this by pointing `$EASYEDA2KICAD` at a
  stub that would fail loudly if called.
- **Record**: to capture a real part, run `jlc_twin` once with the network on
  and copy `OUTDIR/easyeda/<CODE>/` into a fixture dir.

---

## Adding a regression when a new defect is found

This is the whole workflow — follow it every time something ships broken.

1. **Write the known-bad fixture first, and watch it FAIL** against the
   current code. If it passes, you have not reproduced the defect, or the
   gate you are testing is not the gate that missed it.

   ```python
   @test("audit_template FAILS on <the new defect>", kind="known_bad")
   def t_new_defect():
       d, b = fresh_board()
       edit_board(b, "<pcbnew snippet that introduces exactly this defect>")
       r = run([KPY, AUDIT_T, b, "--config", with_audit_cfg(d)])
       must_fail(r, "audit_template on <defect>", "<expected rule id>")
   ```

2. **Fix the checker** so the fixture fails it.

3. **Prove the test has teeth.** Swap the old checker back in and confirm the
   new test fails against it:

   ```sh
   cp skills/.../checker.py /tmp/fixed.py
   git show HEAD:skills/.../checker.py > skills/.../checker.py
   ./tests/run_tests.sh --only="<new test name>"      # must FAIL
   cp /tmp/fixed.py skills/.../checker.py
   ```

   A regression test that passes both before and after the fix is testing
   nothing. Do this step — it is how both gates above were verified.

4. Note the real-world incident in the test's docstring. Every known-bad
   fixture in this suite corresponds to a defect that actually shipped;
   the docstring is where that context lives.

## Which real bytes may a fixture read?

A fixture that asserts something about a REAL board must read bytes that cannot
move under it. Three legal oracles, in order of preference:

1. **A pinned commit** — `git show <COMMIT>:<path>`. The strongest, because the
   path is only a locator. `t1_audit.py`'s `PRENOTCH_COMMIT` and
   `t1_placement_gates.py`'s `PREREDO_COMMIT` do this, and they are immune to
   anything happening in the working tree.
2. **A sealed release** — `07_releases/<rel>/source/…`. Immutable by canon, so a
   verdict derived from it is reproducible (canon M-SHIP).
3. **A live `projects/<board>/04_kicad/…`** — legal only where the assertion
   tolerates the board being regenerated, or where a live read is the POINT
   (catching a regression the moment someone revises that board). Say which in
   a comment.

**Never assert PASS/FAIL content about a live `04_kicad/` board you do not own.**
`04_kicad/` is regenerated from source, and mid-rebuild it is track-free with
netclasses clobbered — exactly what canon R1 warns about, and it was observed as
a test failure on 2026-07-29: `t1_gate_contract.py`'s G-VACUOUS-DRU fixture went
red because cooksense's live `.kicad_dru` did not yet carry the barrier rules
(`apply_drc_policy.py` re-applies them AFTER `generate_rules`) and `KEYPAD_ISO`
was absent from `.kicad_pro`, where netclasses actually live — 0 occurrences live
against 15 in the seal. A gate whose verdict depends on whether a sibling happens
to be rebuilding is not a gate.

**THE TRIGGER FIRED — THIRD INSTANCE, 2026-07-30.** `t1_escape_tier`'s
`t_land_honours_a_scoped_clearance` read the LIVE pluto-rx2-8way board and
asserted five RF launches still fail. True when written; false hours later, when
canon R-SCOPE landed `scoped_clr_rf_*` on that very board and REPAIRED them. The
fixture failed for being right about a board that had moved. Fixed by building
the baseline through `board_copy(drop_rules=...)` — strip the relaxation, prove
the five come back, add it, prove they clear. **That is strictly stronger than
the original**: it is a round trip on real bytes, and what is under test is the
gate's response to the RULE rather than the board's current state.

So the three instances are `t1_fleet_regrade` (a dossier deletion),
`t1_gate_contract` (a mid-rebuild board) and this one (a board that got FIXED) —
and note the third is the one no rule would have predicted: the others broke on
transient states, this one broke on a permanent improvement.

**A CHECKER IS NOW EARNED AND IS STILL NOT BUILT, DELIBERATELY.** All three were
caught by the suite itself within one run of the change that caused them, which
is the outcome a checker would buy — and the repo carries 34 gates and 73+
check-IDs against a standing argument to consolidate. What the pattern actually
teaches is cheaper than a gate and is now the rule above: **a fixture asserting a
defect must CONSTRUCT the defect, never assume a live board still has it.**
Reach for `drop_rules=` / a pinned commit / a sealed release before reaching for
`projects/<board>/04_kicad`. If a FOURTH instance appears that the suite does not
catch in the same run, build the checker then.

**The earlier population count stands.** It was three files and seven
references, measured 2026-07-29, and five of the seven were already correct. A new gate for a seven-item set is the gate sprawl this repo is
starting to pay for: 73 check-IDs across 32 gates, each of which is maintenance
and each of which can itself go vacuous (see G-VACUOUS). The durable asset is the
meta-principles, not another ID. If this class recurs — a third fixture breaking
on mutable project state — that is the evidence that earns a checker, and the
count above is the baseline to compare against.

## Interpreter notes

- `/usr/bin/python3` is the KiCad-bundled interpreter and the only one with
  `pcbnew`. `run_tests.sh` checks for it up front and refuses to run without.
- `audit_template.py` and `classified_drc.py` write pid-suffixed DRC
  reports (`/tmp/audit_drc.<pid>.txt`, `/tmp/classified_drc.<pid>.txt`).
  They used to share two FIXED paths, and a concurrent session (a live
  clean-room canary running the same scripts) clobbered a suite run's
  report mid-read — two t4 flakes with another board's categories in the
  output (2026-07-21). Per-process paths ended that class.
  **AND THEN THIS NOTE BECAME AN EXCUSE.** A SECOND, unrelated flake with a
  similar symptom (`t_subfloor_crossnet_clearance_is_real`, missing `REAL=1`)
  was twice waved off as "the known temp-path flake, commit 2de4b2a" — but it
  measured **3/65 = 4.6% running strictly SERIALLY**, with no concurrency and
  no second `kicad-cli` anywhere, which alone refutes a shared path. It was
  the fixture: the injected track pair sat on the sealed board's existing
  copper, KiCad emits one violation class per neighbourhood, and pcbnew's
  `Save()` does not order Python-added tracks stably. Fixed 2026-07-27 by
  moving the pair to clear copper and making the fixture assert its own
  isolation; the `REAL=1` expectation was NOT weakened. **A named prior flake
  is a hypothesis, not a diagnosis — measure the rate before you reuse the
  name.**
- No pytest: `harness.py` is a ~60-line runner so the suite runs on the
  KiCad interpreter with zero installs.

## 2026-07-28 gate batch — what each new fixture pins

Not every suite has a row above; these landed in this batch and are recorded
here so the coverage is legible.

* **`t1_rotation_authority`** — `jlc_rotation_measure` reads the pin-1 mark in
  the footprint-LOCAL frame. `our_pads()` used `GetFPRelativePosition()`
  (local) while `our_marks()` used `GetStart() - fp.GetPosition()` (BOARD), so
  the PIN-1-MARK channel ran exactly `board_rot` degrees out of step. ONE PART
  placed at 0/90/180/270 must give ONE answer with an identical distance
  multiset — turning a part on the board cannot change which angle of JLC's
  model matches our land. Known-bad: a model marking pin 1 at the WRONG END
  must raise **PIN-1 DISSENT**, withhold the row and exit nonzero, with an
  inline adjacent-property re-verify that the corrected fixture still passes.
* **`t1_electrical_invariants`** — E-ADR skips a `status: superseded` ADR
  (pluto-cal-switch 12 protection ADRs -> 10, FAIL 11/12 -> PASS 10/10), and
  the known-bad proves the skip reads the STATUS and not the presence of the
  word: `accepted`, the template's own
  `accepted # ... | superseded-by-0012` placeholder (on 10 live ADRs), and
  `proposed` must all still FAIL.
* **`t1_bom_source`** — the FH/Fenghua voltage-suffix ceramics
  (`0402CG101J500NT`) decode; a bare digit-run and a four-digit suffix still
  return None; and a standing cross-check runs the decoder against all 146
  vetted ledger rows, whose catalog-verified `value:` fields are an
  INDEPENDENT authority (0 disagreements, with a denominator assertion so the
  check cannot quietly stop covering anything).
* **`t1_power_topology`** — a sub-amp trunk current prints at full precision
  (`.1f` rendered 0.126 A as `0.1 A` and anything under 0.05 A as `0.0 A`),
  the UNDER-BUILT finding cannot quote the SAME number as both quantities, and
  the amp-scale `6.8 A` figure is asserted UNCHANGED so the fix does not
  rewrite every archived report.

**HARNESS INTEGRITY re-measured on this batch** (the commit-`0dd56ab` class,
where the runner could exit 0 while reporting failures): breaking one new
assertion makes `run_tests.sh --only=pin-1` print `1 passed, 1 failed` /
`FAILURES PRESENT` and **exit 1**; restored, exit 0. Measure the runner's own
status, not a pipeline's — `./tests/run_tests.sh | tail` reports `tail`'s exit
code and reads as a false all-clear.

## 2026-07-29 — `t1_schema_reader` (canon G-ORPHAN)

`schema_reader_audit.py` grades the SKILL, not a board: every schema key a
hand-authored source file may declare must name the gate that reads it, and the
named gate must PROVABLY read it (AST read positions, never a grep). 24 tests,
10 known-bad, 1 declared vacuity.

* **The headline known-bad is the R-LEN discrimination.** A reader that carries
  the exact key name as a plain assignment and a message, and reads it nowhere,
  must FAIL with `MENTION` in the finding — and the fixture asserts inline that
  the pre-fix predicate (`re.search(key, source_text)`, which passed
  smc0985-cooksense on two comments about a creepage slot being lengthened)
  CREDITS that same reader. A real red against the wrong algorithm rather than
  against a file that did not exist yesterday.
* **Both halves on one input.** An `ADVISORY` key with a reason PASSES; the
  same key in the same tree with that one contract row deleted FAILS as an
  ORPHAN. Same for the vacuity's contrast: one row moved from `OWED` to a named
  reader that does not read it flips the verdict.
* **Four REAL findings are asserted against real bytes**, each with its
  contrast so the fixture cannot pass vacuously: a policy waiver is applied by
  `id` ALONE (neither `policy_audit.py` nor `waiver_provenance.py` reads
  `refs:`, while both read `id`); `power_topology.py` reaches `linear_rails`
  nowhere while reading its sibling `rails`; `rules_audit.py` reads `current`
  and not `intent`/`routing`/`verify`; and `pins.<N>.tie` is read by none of
  four candidate gates across 43 real dossiers. Each assertion FAILS LOUDLY
  when the finding is closed, naming the contract row to move off `OWED` —
  the ratchet, not a regression.
* **`VACUITY_FLOOR` in `gate_contract_audit.py` rose 5 -> 6 in the same
  commit**, because this gate declares a blind spot (it passes a family whose
  every key is `OWED`). `t_vacuity_floor_is_pinned_to_the_measured_count`
  measures the tree, so the number could not have been left behind.

**HARNESS INTEGRITY re-measured on this suite:** breaking one new assertion
makes `run_tests.sh --only='PROVABLY reads'` print `0 passed, 1 failed` /
`FAILURES PRESENT` and exit 1; restored it prints `1 passed, 0 failed` (and
still exits 1, because that filter selects no known-bad fixture and the runner
refuses to report success on zero — which is the guard working, not a flake).

**This suite has 8 sibling failures in a FRESH WORKTREE and they are not
regressions:** `06_build/` is gitignored, so `t1_electrical_invariants` (6) and
`t1_net_reference` (2) cannot find `archived_projects/smc0985-cooksense/06_build/
netlists/cooksense.net` or the pluto-cal-switch netlists their real-bytes
fixtures require. Full run in this worktree: **861 passed, 8 failed, 512
known-bad**, every failure that one cause.

## Native finite launch contract

`t1_land_witness.py` maintains complete-class public RED/GREEN acceptance and
exact UUID-bound native Track–Pad controls using `pipeline_runtime.run_stage`.
Fixture children are bounded to 60 seconds; full suites to 300 seconds. All
raw triples, native JSON, exact argv/PID/times/exit and full output persist in
TMPDIR. No transient source/evidence paths are used. Native fixture membership
is explicit, including 36 matrix outcomes, ten local precedence cases, exact
tolerance boundaries (including native epsilon zero), no-net Default classes,
and thirteen ADC witnesses on immutable subject bytes. Full hostile search
is independently covered in bounded native batches to avoid report caps.
The primary neutral public assertion was RED on cb0d0cf6 (X1.1 false rejection,
2 graded/5 copper/3 floorless), then GREEN on the native implementation.
`t2_pcb_flow.py` records a separate helper-only handoff mutation RED/GREEN.
`t1_escape_tier.py` preserves exact CAL eleven identities/floors, RX2 five
clearance contrasts, CRC census/incident inventory and QSPI/zero/unreadable
controls; historical maximum-width assertions have become finite witness
assertions, with no lowered known-bad counts.

The catalog absence classifier also accepts one fresh, recorded exact public API `Component not found` response after importer failure. Transport/authentication failures, redirects and ambiguous JSON still fail closed. The extended-SMD registration fixture proves actual rendered-body overlap, full pad counts, cache reopening, detached-pad and inverted-body rejection; analytic area, tangent, rounded-corner and rotated-pad controls exercise native copper intersection.

Fab envelope regression: footprint labels formerly inflated native expected-body bounds. The test is RED against the pre-fix collector and GREEN with geometric shapes only, covering both board sides, four rotations, and text-only absence. Authored drawing stroke remains part of the geometric envelope.

`t1_assembly_locator.py` is the default-runner entry for the assembly locator.
It exercises the actual public CLI with complete and missing-page fixtures and
runs the native identity, HTML behavior, PDF/page and owning-consumer controls.
The visual-acceptance regression overwrites a visible page ID while preserving
PNG identity metadata, rebuilds the PDF and refreshes file hashes. Structural
checking still passes, but the exact independent render review must stale at
both placement and release. The two acceptance controls were RED against the
original checker and GREEN after binding the existing review to the manifest
and exact reviewed-reference set. No alternate approval artifact is created.

`t1_model_registration.py` checks mounted-side native Fab/courtyard ownership with opposite-side decoys, mixed-side refusal, and asymmetric real flipped bodies at 0/90/270 degrees. Actual front/back coupon renders must pass; incorrect declarations, displaced/inverted/rotated models and a deliberately unmirrored bottom pixel projection must fail. Side and geometry changes invalidate tuple/cache acceptance while failed attempts preserve accepted bundles. The mounted-side tests were run RED against the frozen pre-fix native engine (SHA256 `998dc6971ffec1ff0ded358631b10e167bdff371c8221f6f747324ad6852c5d8`) by actual source swap, then GREEN after restoration.

`t1_model_registration.py` also pins the native signed-side visibility blind
spot through G-VACUOUS: first reproduce the inverted 1 mm nested-transform
body false PASS, then require a signed-side FAIL when only height changes to
3 mm with translation h/2. This is visible-pixel evidence, not full-volume
board exclusion; independent exact-model geometry remains separately required.


Native plan extraction also has a thin-feature sampling limitation. Two
3x3 erosions can delete actual exterior features before the surviving-pixel
union is measured, and restoring two pixels does not recover them. A PASS
therefore does not establish complete occupied extent at every coupon scale.
The bound G-VACUOUS fixture first requires a false PASS for an actual thin
exterior feature beyond courtyard, then requires FAIL for a thicker feature
at the same extent. Where this property matters, supplement ordinary
P-MODEL-REG with independent exact-model native full-extent/courtyard evidence
and original un-eroded images; an actual exterior feature outside courtyard
must fail or remain incomplete even if the eroded-pixel gate passes. Fab is a
union of geometric marks, so exterior-feature detail changes its bbox datum
and does not separately recognize a retained nominal-shell rectangle. Preserve
independent primary-drawing shell and attachment-datum evidence. Nominal CAD
containment is not a manufacturing-tolerance or physical-fit guarantee.

The assembly locator native suite additionally proves mixed-side context using
real flipped asymmetric bodies/pads at 0/90/270 degrees and opposite-side Fab
decoys. Mounted-side visibility preserves the top exception set. The new
property tests were RED on the frozen top-only generator (R3 rejected) and
checker (native frame mutation accepted), then GREEN on the correction.
Known-bad controls reject wrong side/body, absent owned Fab, unmirrored bottom
HTML, wrong bottom CPL side, frame and convention changes. The shipped UI
script is exercised over every reference, side, crosshair and unknown-query
transition. The original 25 identity/packaging/consumer controls remain.

`t1_locator_publication.py` is the dependency-free publication companion. It
removes both `pcbnew` and Pillow at import time, requires the actual sealed Crow
carrier archive to pass from hashes and frozen identity, and requires a missing
hashed member to fail. CI runs it before publication admission.


Pin-audit mounted-frame regressions use native asymmetric front/back footprints under both flip axes and six rotations; prove a deliberate physical-pin mirror retains wrong winding, preserve native positions/nets and declared aliases, and require mounted-side/component-top/native-board-coordinate dossier fields. RED against c4acef1e; GREEN after mounted-frame extraction.


Locator startup regression: each URL case executes the shipped script in a
fresh DOM, before any valid selection can initialize its mounted-side filter.
Empty/default, explicit top/bottom, unknown and malformed percent-encoded
fragments are checked separately. Invalid startup shows no component geometry,
clears identity/crosshair/hash, and leaves search and side controls functional.
This regression was RED against reviewed candidate1 (unknown showed both sides;
malformed decoding threw), then GREEN with fail-closed initialization. Existing
unknown-after-valid, all-reference, side-switch and empty-side controls remain.

Assembly-side coverage regressions in `t1_assembly_gates.py` exercise the public
CLI against independently authored board/CPL bytes. Four known-bad families
(bottom SMD, manual bottom SMD, false/empty CPL sides and malformed allowed
sides) were RED against the pre-fix checker on 2026-09-13, which exited zero.
The corrected gate passes these plus top-only/two-side and nonpopulation/THT
controls. This verifies declared mounting sides, not assembly clearance or
physical solderability.

Independent assembly-side review found that a duplicate DNP declaration could
erase an explicit manual fit. Both row orders and a test-point variant are
regressed: RED against the first side-check candidate, GREEN after duplicate
dispositions fail while their SMD remains in the population denominator.

Exact segment widening has a native positive/idempotence fixture and six hostile
controls (narrowing, stale endpoint/width, unknown key, duplicate row), proving
whole-batch validation precedes mutation. It was RED before the emitter existed.

Seed-pad contact regression was RED at carrier1251 before native copper-shape
intersection replaced endpoint-only contact, then GREEN at1252 with disjoint
and opposite-layer controls. Seed netclass-pair regression was RED at1259
before source floors were consumed and GREEN at1260: a lower search minimum
cannot undercut either netclass, and hole-clearance semantics remain separate.
Thermal-angle source selection was RED at1255 before the emitter and GREEN
at1258 with selected-pad preservation and six malformed/nonfinite controls;
1256/1257 exposed test exception/import wiring errors and are not green evidence.

Exact via relocation was RED at carrier1263 before the emitter, then GREEN at
1264 with native identity/idempotence and eight hostile controls. Fine-via
source binding was RED at1265 and GREEN at1266/1270: enabled typed relocations
transform source seeds; unbound nonordinary origins, duplicates, mismatches,
unsupported layers and nonfinite coordinates fail. No resistance formula or
limit changed. Broader route/stitch1262-independent suite1272:138 passed,
56 known-bad controls, two explicit slow omissions. Generator1268:70 passed.

Crow source regression reconciliation (2026-09-16) retains exact digital no-via,
10:1 aspect, finite copper clearance and ordinary-pad via prohibitions. The
integrated source was RED for a .15mm reset drill and an ADC3P via inside an
ordinary capacitor land; both required geometry corrections. Stale baseline
expectations now reflect the co-designed supervisor launches, CFG timer bundle,
54 actual current-transfer banks and explicit thermal angles. The angle census
adds missing/duplicate/invalid/changed-value hostile controls, and the ground
capsule census includes stitch seeds without admitting undeclared narrow copper.

Placement thermal applicability regression was RED at carrier1316 and GREEN at
1317: 9 cases, including 7 known-bad controls. Only native starved_thermal rows
on an unrouted board are deferred, with exact row identities emitted. Connected
thermals, mixed shorts/clearances/hole/library/unknown errors and parity fail.
Shared rebuild templates1318:67 passed; contracts1320:17 passed after staging
five intended Crow source/review files (1319 had correctly rejected untracked
project membership). Final native DRC and release gates are unchanged.

`t1_publication_gate.py` now removes a hashed auxiliary payload while keeping the board/reviews green. This was RED against the pre-fix publication gate (empty finding list), then GREEN with full manifest census. Tampered and unlisted payload controls remain required; 31 publication tests pass, including18 hostile fixtures.

### Modular impact and issue telemetry

`pipeline_registry.change_impact` is diagnostic, not cache admission. Its
placement/routing/native-check/staging fixture preserves independent sourcing,
propagates changed source/output/method inputs, and rejects unknown change keys.
Removing downstream propagation was mutation-tested RED (three targeted
failures); restoring it returns GREEN. Real conductor coverage remains a
separate migration obligation.

`t1_pipeline_issue_ledger.py` exercises append-only attribution, provider/event
identity conflicts, concurrency, missing/partial usage, interval union and
incomplete records. `t2_pcb_flow.py` runs the native route-ownership validator
both directly and through the opt-in accounting path: a clean declared corridor
passes and an unknown corridor wave fails with the same exit. It also proves a
malformed start prevents launch and terminal persistence failure preserves the
command failure while leaving an incomplete ledger record. Bypassing start
admission was mutation-tested RED, then restored GREEN. The decision-progress
suite joins accounting to the existing reserved attempt and proves that an
unassessed launch still blocks another attempt. These checks prove
accounting and boundary behavior, not whole-board routability or release readiness.


Offline usage ingestion is covered by `t1_pipeline_usage_import.py` (11 tests,
7 known-bads) and `t1_openrouter_usage_adapter.py` (5 tests, 1 known-bad).
Fixtures distinguish increments from cumulative totals, retain unknown fields,
deduplicate parent/child observations despite different observer timestamps,
and reject conflicts, invented timing and malformed tails before any append.
Missing/unexpected sessions and unassigned turns prevent complete-coverage
claims. Removing unexpected-session coverage was mutation-tested RED, then
restored GREEN. Imports are accounting only; no provider calls or board writes.


`t2_route_neighborhood.py` creates project-independent 0.5 mm-pitch launch
coupons. Each net alone is legal; composing the rejected branches yields an
exact foreign-net native DRC conflict in either insertion order. The corrected
pair retains all terminals, zero unconnected items, front copper and no vias.
Unexpected native violation types also fail; corrected and isolated arms have
zero total native violations.
This proves fixed-witness composition, not autorouter completeness or unique
corridor blockage. `t2_scoped_pad_clearance.py` also checks a same-net thin trace
whose centreline lies outside a width-rule area while its copper edge overlaps.
Trimming the area removes only that collateral finding; an intended thin probe
still fails, while outside and wrong-net controls remain exempt. These are
native diagnostic property tests, not claims of full-board DRC acceptance.
