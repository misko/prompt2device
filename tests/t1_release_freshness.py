"""T1: the RELEASE-ARTIFACT FRESHNESS gate
(`skills/jlcpcb-fab/scripts/release_freshness_check.py`).

Motivating incident (usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.2, 2026-07-23): a REDESIGNED board
sealed and shipped DO-NOT-ORDER because three independent defects all slipped
past every existing gate:

  (a) STALE ARTIFACT — pdf/assembly_{front,back}.pdf + pdf/pcb_layers.pdf were
      byte-identical (sha256-confirmed) to the PRIOR release v1.1's same-named
      files: the redesigned board shipped the OLD board's fab drawings.
  (b) AUDIT / MANIFEST DISAGREEMENT — verification/policy_audit.md said
      "M-BOM FAIL" / "Summary: FAIL=1" while the MANIFEST claimed
      "policy_audit: 0 FAIL" / "M-BOM ... PASS".
  (c) DRAFT README — the shipped ORDER_README.md was a working draft.

Second motivating incident (crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.0, sealed 2026-07-23,
found 2026-07-24) — check (d) MANIFEST SELF-CONSISTENCY: the manifest's
human-readable gate summary disagreed with the machine evidence it SHIPS and
no gate caught it: MANIFEST "ERC 0 errors (1409 baselined warnings)" vs
policy_audit.md "S-ERC PASS 0 errors (1215 warnings)" (erc.json measures
1409); MANIFEST "bom_source_check PASS (48 lines...)" vs fab/bom.csv's 49
actual data rows; and verification/bom_source_check.txt naming
"07_releases/v1.0-2026-07-23/fab/bom.csv" — not the sealed directory name
(crow-recorder-central-v2-v1.0-2026-07-23). The section-(d) fixtures below
use those EXACT mismatches. RED-VERIFIED (git-swap, 2026-07-24): with git
HEAD's pre-change release_freshness_check.py swapped back in, every
known-bad case in section (d) FAILS (the old gate passes the broken
releases, and `--_disable-manifest-consistency` is an unknown argument),
then the fixed script restored and all pass — see the git-swap note at the
section header.

Fixtures are SELF-CONTAINED synthetic release trees built in a tmpdir (the
sealed real releases are immutable and never written). Each known-bad fixture
breaks exactly ONE of the three, so the test proves the gate reacts to THAT
defect. RED-VERIFY: every known-bad case is re-run with that one check
neutered (`--_disable-*`) and shown to PASS — proving the finding comes from
the check under test and nothing else. A gate that cannot fail is worthless.

# ---------------------------------------- docs-only supersede mode
# usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.4 (2026-07-23): a documentation-only supersede release
# INTENTIONALLY ships fab/ byte-identical to its predecessor — the board did
# not change, only the docs did. The default stale check flags exactly that
# identity as a defect; `--docs-only-supersede <prior>` ASSERTS the declared
# identity instead: fab/source/3d MUST match the prior byte-for-byte (any
# deviation FAILs — a "docs-only" release that changes fab is lying),
# identical pdf/ is allowed, and ORDER_README + MANIFEST MUST differ.
# RED-VERIFIED (git-swap, 2026-07-23): against pre-change
# release_freshness_check.py the flag is an unrecognized argument (argparse
# exit 2 carrying none of the asserted findings), so every docs-only case
# below goes RED — verified by swapping git HEAD's script back in (all four
# docs-only tests failed), then restoring the fixed script (all pass). The
# default mode is byte-for-byte untouched: t_stale_pdf / t_stale_fab above
# still prove the normal-mode identical-artifact teeth.

# ------------------------------------------ sourcing supersede mode (canon M8)
# RED-VERIFIED 2026-07-27 (tests/README step 3, GIT-SWAP variant): with
# `git show HEAD:skills/jlcpcb-fab/scripts/release_freshness_check.py` swapped
# back in, EVERY test in this section dies on "unrecognized arguments:
# --sourcing-supersede" (argparse exit 2, carrying none of the asserted
# findings) — the mode cannot pass vacuously, because it did not exist.
# MEASURED: pre-fix `--only=sourcing` reports **0 passed, 14 failed, 0
# known-bad**; the fixed script restored, **14 passed, 0 failed, 13 known-bad**.
# Acceptance beyond the fixtures: the mode PASSES the REAL sealed
# usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.11 against v1.10 (10 measured notes replacing the seven file
# waivers that release shipped) and the REAL crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.7
# against v1.6.
#
# WHY THE MODE EXISTS. JLC refusing to SUPPLY a line is neither a design defect
# nor a paperwork defect. usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.10's BOM was uploaded and line 8 came
# back "10 shortfall" (C25744, the only basic-library 10k 0402, stockCount 0);
# the fix substitutes an electrically identical part AT SOURCE and moves no
# copper. None of the four earlier modes covers that: docs-only requires fab/
# byte-identical, cpl-only permits only coordinates, bom-only only ROW REMOVAL,
# and legible-bom explicitly FAILS a changed LCSC. So v1.11 sealed gated by
# SEVEN hand-written file waivers instead of an assertion — weaker evidence than
# the release it superseded. crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.7 is the second board
# needing it, and canon M8 makes the second one MANDATORY.

# --------------------------------------- value-change supersede mode
# RED-VERIFIED 2026-07-28 (tests/README step 3, GIT-SWAP variant): with
# `git show HEAD:skills/jlcpcb-fab/scripts/release_freshness_check.py` swapped
# back in, EVERY test in this section dies on "unrecognized arguments:
# --value-change-supersede" (argparse exit 2, carrying none of the asserted
# findings) — the mode cannot pass vacuously, because it did not exist.
# MEASURED: pre-fix `--only=value-change` reports **0 passed, 18 failed, 0
# known-bad**; with the new script restored, **18 passed, 0 failed, 17
# known-bad**. Whole file: **56 passed, 18 failed, 41 known-bad** pre-fix ->
# **74 passed, 0 failed, 58 known-bad** post-fix.
#
# A git-swap red on a brand-new flag proves only that the flag is NEW, not that
# its assertions bite — so each of the three HEADLINE assertions additionally
# carries an ADJACENT-PROPERTY red-verify INLINE, re-measured on every run: the
# same fixture tree with the one broken property RESTORED must PASS. Same
# input, opposite verdict, in the same test. That is what shows the finding
# came from THAT assertion and not from some unrelated malformation of the
# fixture (the class ADR-0005 was written for: a fixture whose defect was
# order-dependent, excused twice as a known flake).
#
# HARNESS INTEGRITY, re-measured on this section 2026-07-28 — the runner itself
# was once able to exit 0 while reporting failures (commit 0dd56ab), so a new
# suite that cannot fail the RUN is worth as little as a gate that cannot fail.
# Breaking one assertion here (`contains(r.out, "A-POS", ...)` -> a string that
# is not in the output) makes `./tests/run_tests.sh --only=value-change` print
# `TOTAL 17 passed, 1 failed` / `FAILURES PRESENT` and EXIT 1. Restored, the
# same command is green.
#
# WHY THE MODE EXISTS, measured on crow-mic-pod-v2 v1.3, 2026-07-28
# (08_reviews/2026-07-28_v1.3_fix-verification_cal1.md, the CAL-1
# re-derivation). `export_jlc_package.py:349` reads `val = fp.GetValue()` FROM
# THE BOARD and feeds that ONE string to BOTH the BOM `Comment` column and the
# CPL `Val` column. So changing a VMID divider from 22k to 33k/18k on two
# ALREADY-PLACED 0603 resistors moves the `.kicad_pcb` md5, the `.kicad_sch`,
# the `.net`, the BOM rows for those refs and exactly 2 CPL `Val` cells — while
# **all 11 gerbers and drills are byte-identical** (measured 11/11, the method
# validated by re-plotting the sealed v1.3 zip from its own archived board).
# Every earlier mode refuses that shape, each for its own good reason:
# docs-only needs fab/ byte-identical; bom-only permits only row REMOVAL and
# only for refs NOT on the CPL (R4/R5 are on it); legible-bom reads a changed
# LCSC as a substitution; sourcing demands an md5-identical board and a
# byte-identical CPL, and a value change moves both; and cpl-only names a `Val`
# change as its own explicit exclusion. The result was that a legitimate,
# copper-identical value fix was unsealable without hand-editing a CSV — which
# canon M3 forbids. This mode asserts the REAL invariant instead.
#
# FIXTURE VALUES. The incident's own pair is 22k -> 33k/18k, and the fixture
# uses 22k -> 47k/18k for one measured reason: `C4216` (33k, 0603WAF3302T5E) is
# NOT a vetted row in `lcsc_passives_ledger.yaml` and has no `02_parts` dossier,
# so a BOM carrying it cannot pass F-LEGIBLE — which the review recorded as its
# own finding, and which this mode's F-LEGIBLE clause would (correctly) block.
# C31850/C25819/C25810 are all vetted ledger rows, so the fixture exercises the
# delta assertions rather than dying on the sourcing gap.

# ================ (f) A-BUY + (g) M-REV — THE TWO-CLAIM SPLIT ================
#
# A seal makes TWO claims and this gate used to have ONE field for both:
#
#     | claim                      | who can answer it              |
#     | *this design is correct*   | the design gates, at SEAL time |
#     | *this design is orderable* | the CATALOG, at ORDER time     |
#
# Every check above grades an artifact WE CONTROL, so a red means "there exists
# an edit to this design that turns it green" and blocking the seal is right.
# A-STOCK grades the WORLD — it reads a vendor's live stockCount (0 on
# 2026-07-29, 5 on 2026-07-30, same unchanged board) and no edit to the design
# changes it. Measured cost of merging the two: smc0985-cooksense v1.7 reached
# DRC 0/0/0, policy_audit FAIL=0, ERC 0 and both red-team lenses graded, and
# NINE successive agents declined to seal it, every one on one BOM line. Nine
# refusals, zero design defects.
#
# RED-VERIFIED (git-swap against 7b6d0aa1, 2026-07-30 — the commit immediately
# before checks (f)/(g) existed). MEASURED, both directions:
#   - pre-change file swapped in:  0 passed, 22 FAILED. 16 of the 17 known-bad
#     fixtures SEAL CLEAN under the old gate — their primary assertion reports
#     "SHOULD HAVE FAILED but exited 0". The undeclared-BLOCKED release, the
#     plan whose own measured number does not cover the build, the lens file
#     with no verdict and the lens grading a BLOCKED release ORDER all pass,
#     because nothing read any of those fields. The 17th
#     (`t_kb_review_design_defective_blocks_design_claim`) could not even be
#     EXPRESSED: `--claim design` comes back "unrecognized arguments", which
#     is itself the proof that the pre-change gate had no second claim to
#     grade.
#   - restored:                    22 passed, 0 failed (17 known-bad).
#
# Each known-bad ALSO carries the inline red-verify this file uses throughout:
# the same fixture re-run with exactly one check neutered (`--_disable-order` /
# `--_disable-reviews`) must PASS, proving the finding comes from the check
# under test and nothing else.
#
# NAMING: the check is `A-BUY`, not `A-ORDER`. `rules_audit.py`'s A-ORDER has
# meant "generate_rules must run LAST" since 2026-07-17 (ae93b4b) and is cited
# by name in tests/README.md, t4_regressions.py, t1_rules_bom.py and
# t1_assembly_gates.py. Two policies under one ID is worse than a missing ID.
#
# ...AND THIS SECTION REPRODUCED THAT EXACT DEFECT IN ITS FIRST DRAFT. Its
# fixture constants were first written as `_BOM`/`_CPL`, and `_CPL` was already
# a module-level constant 1400 lines up that the cpl-only-supersede tests read
# AT CALL TIME. Python rebinds silently, so the later definition won, and three
# PRE-EXISTING tests started grading the wrong fixture — passing 93/3 where the
# baseline was 74/0. The names here are `_CLAIM_BOM`/`_CLAIM_CPL`. **Prefix new
# module-level fixture constants in this file with their section**, and if you
# are unsure, the check is four lines of `ast` over `tree.body` counting
# top-level `Assign`/`FunctionDef` targets — it reports NONE on this file today.
