"""T1: the repo-structure gate — scripts/contracts_audit.py (canon M7).

Motivating incidents (2026-07-21):
- template/ at repo root drifted from the skill-owned stage contracts
  unnoticed (the skill's 02_parts contract gained the escape-block schema;
  template/'s copy did not) — two homes, silent divergence.
- skills/kicad-pcb cited a live project's proof artifact
  (archived_projects/cook-loadcell/03_tscircuit/backend_proof/...) — a path a
  clean-room worktree cannot resolve and a contamination vector.

RED-VERIFIED (new-gate variant): contracts_audit.py did not exist before
this commit — at 656bab3 there is no scripts/ directory, so every case
below fails with "no such file"; the gate could not exist. The tampered
fixtures were additionally verified to FAIL against the CURRENT auditor
run on an untampered copy (each breaks a passing tree in exactly one way).

    being read as COVERAGE and fixed the REPORTING, so the verdict now carries
    its denominator (t_repo_clean, above). They stopped there. **The gap was
    made VISIBLE without being made to COST anything.** This repo has ratchet
    FLOORS and no CEILINGS, so an honestly declared gap is free — and
    `t_repo_clean` went on running the WIDE scope on every suite run while
    asserting exactly one thing about it, that the output does not contain
    `NOT GRADED`. **It never looked at `w.rc`.** MEASURED at c0e21fa7 before
    this change: `contracts_audit.py --projects` = **2674 violations, RAW EXIT
    1**, on every suite run since, silently.

    WHAT THIS ASSERTS: `--projects` exits 0, and it does so because the measured
    per-unit debt EQUALS the recorded ceiling, not because there is nothing
    wrong. Equality, not `<=`: an improvement must lower its row in the same

    file that is neither tracked nor ignored is either a violation or something
    that should not be in the repo, and THAT is the population: MEASURED
    2026-07-31, 227883 - 220360 = **7523** = 7414 tracked + 109 untracked.
    VERIFIED BY TWO INDEPENDENT METHODS whose SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE IS 0: an
    external `find` walk piped through `git check-ignore --stdin`, and git's own
    `ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` (canon M1).

    WHY THE UNTRACKED HALF IS RATCHETED ON PRESENCE AND NOT ON VIOLATIONS —
    this is the part that is not obvious and it is MEASURED below: **a copy of
    a governed tree carries its `contracts.md` files with it, so every file in
    it is permitted by its own ancestor and the audit reports `0 violations`,
    RAW EXIT 0.** The 3.1 GB stray `git worktree` found at this repo's root on
    2026-07-31 was exactly that — a self-governing, perfectly clean copy. A
    violation-counting stray gate grades it GREEN. What is wrong with a stray
    worktree is that it EXISTS.

    AND IT IS A SET OF UNITS, NOT A FILE COUNT: a count over an in-flight board
    flaps on every file its author writes, and a ratchet that fails on correct
    work is a ratchet that gets deleted (the `PREC_OWED_CEILING` lesson,
    policy_audit.py 2026-07-30). *Which* corners may hold uncommitted work is a
    PROPERTY, unmoved by how much work happens inside a declared corner.

    THE SCOPING CONTROL, and it is a real control because it must go SILENT:
    the eleven `~*.kicad_pro.lck` files strewn across the fleet on 2026-07-31 —
    four of them inside SEALED releases — were gitignored that morning. A
    correctly scoped population reports ZERO of them; a population still
    listing them would be walking, not scoping. Asserted below by creating one.

    the end of `` `build/pcb.svg`, `` is a COMMA — so the trailing backtick
    survived and the pattern became the literal ``build/pcb.svg`,``, which
    matches no file that can exist.

    THE LAST ITEM OF EVERY SUCH LIST HAS NO TRAILING COMMA and therefore parsed
    fine, which is exactly why this looked like one odd file rather than a
    parser fault: in the 03_tscircuit contract's `--study` row,
    `build/board.gltf` was permitted and `build/assembly.svg` — named on the
    SAME LINE of the SAME cell — was not.

    """THE INCIDENT. `skills/kicad-pcb/references/fab_tiers.yaml:130` carries
    the exact sentence a release's ORDER_README must contain, as an
    `order_readme:` field, and **no script reads it** — `grep -rn order_readme
    skills/` returns 3 yaml values and 1 line of SKILL.md prose. That is how
    `pluto-rx2-8way-v2`'s ORDER_README came to name no fab option at all while
    **3446 of its 3496 plated holes** sit under the no-fee tier's 0.30 mm
    floor. A field nobody reads is not a weak control, it is the APPEARANCE of
    one: the value is right there in the canon, so a reader checking whether
    the requirement is captured finds that it is.

    SCOPED BY MEASUREMENT FIRST, because a check that cannot pass is not a
    gate. MEASURED 2026-07-31: **47 declared fields across the 4
    `skills/**/references/*.yaml`; 9 have no Python reader.** All four files
    ARE loaded by real scripts, so every one of the 9 is a genuine
    declared-never-read field rather than a prose document miscounted as
    config.

    DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE, named rather than omitted:
      * CONTAINER keys (a key whose value is a mapping) — `jlc_2layer_default`
        and the other 3 tier ids are looked up dynamically; demanding a string
        literal for them is a check that cannot pass. 56 keys total, 47 fields.
      * `skills/kicad-pcb/gradelib/sitecustomize.py`, which writes 8 fields per
        trace of which 4 have no consumer (task #60). It is not a reference
        yaml and it is another agent's file; the same rule applies to it and it
        is not graded here.
      * every `03_src/**` project schema (`part.yaml`, `floorplan.yaml`, …).
        Far more fields, and their consumers live in the generic backend; that
        is a second, larger sweep, not this one.

    RED-VERIFIED 2026-07-31, all three directions, each `16 passed, 1 failed`
    with RAW EXIT 1, and `17 passed, 0 failed` restored after each:
      * LOOSEN `proven-parts.yaml` 2 -> 3 -> FAILED, `got 2, want 3`. Slack
        cannot be banked, so wiring a field up must lower its row.
      * DELETE the `fab_tiers.yaml: 1` row -> FAILED,
        `UNRATCHETED skills/kicad-pcb/references/fab_tiers.yaml: 1 orphan
        field(s) ['order_readme'] and no row`. The map cannot be satisfied by
        omission.
      * INVENT a row for `lcsc_passives_ledger.yaml`, whose 3 fields all have
        consumers -> FAILED, `STALE ORPHAN_CEILING row`. A bound nothing
        measures is not a bound.
