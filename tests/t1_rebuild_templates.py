"""T1: the skill-owned 03_src rebuild driver TEMPLATES.

WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS (2026-07-23): the deterministic promoted-chain rebuild
driver was independently rewritten by THREE boards (usb-hub-3s-v2 and -v3
`rebuild_fast.sh`, crow-recorder-central-v2 `rebuild_reuse.sh`) — a canon M8
two-strike violation. The pattern is now the skill-owned template
`skills/pcb-design/templates/03_src/rebuild_reuse.sh`. These are PROPERTY
assertions on the template text + `bash -n` — never byte-golden, and never an
execution of a real board rebuild (that is the --slow e2e tier's job).

The properties pinned here are each a paid-for incident:
  * generate_rules runs BEFORE import (canon R1) and LAST again after stitch
    (pcbnew saves clobber .kicad_pro netclasses — 2026-07-17, `ae93b4b`).
  * the DRC gate carries --severity-all --refill-zones --schematic-parity on
    ONE invocation (violations are classified at full severity, zones are
    refilled, and parity actually runs).
  * the pinned .kicad_sch is copied beside the board BEFORE the DRC call —
    without it --schematic-parity SILENTLY SKIPS (crow-rv2 finding,
    routing.md M-REPRO entry, 2026-07-23).
  * rebuild_reuse.sh never invokes tsci/tsci-build — `tsci build` is
    non-deterministic (~2900-line UUID/ordering churn in the regenerated
    .kicad_sch, measured on crow-rv2); the committed sch is PINNED canonical.
  * rebuild_all.sh hands the converter the artifact `tsci build` ACTUALLY
    WROTE (M-FRESH, 2026-07-30 — see below).
  * rebuild_all.sh promotes its generated schematic to the pinned reuse path
    only AFTER the schematic checkpoint and both exact reviews pass, but
    BEFORE placement. Otherwise a deliberate placement-review pause leaves
    rebuild_reuse.sh silently replaying the topology from before the TSX edit.

M-FRESH (2026-07-30, pluto-rx2-8way-v2). `tsci build` writes
`03_tscircuit/dist/src/<TSX>/circuit.json`; this template read
`03_tscircuit/build/circuit.json`, a path the builder never writes. The
converter consumed a SUPERSEDED file and TSX-PRE, S-NETMERGE, E-INV, E-ADR,
E-TOPO, E-MARGIN, S-COUNT, E-NETREF and M-BOM all reported green against an
entire obsolete pad-numbering scheme. No checker was wrong — they graded
exactly what they were handed. The path fix alone is worth nothing (the next
mis-wiring is free), so the driver now stamps before the build and VERIFIES
after it, via `skills/kicad-pcb/scripts/build_provenance.py`. The known-bads
below drive that checker directly, because a template-text assertion can only
prove the wiring is right today.

    Three hours fifty-five minutes of design revision that the shipped
    schematic does not show — and the release contract copies exactly that PDF
    into `pdf/schematic.pdf`. Every gate was green, because this is the one
    artifact M-FRESH did not cover: F-PATH grades the MACHINE input
    (circuit.json), and the human document had no gate at all.

    The fixture reproduces the ORDERING, which is the whole fact: the render
    predates the producer. It is not a content check — there is nothing to
    compare a PDF to — and that limit is declared in the module's VACUITY block
    and fixtured below.

    subset — which is what shows the fixtures grade different facts rather than
    one fact three times. Baseline 25 passed / 0 failed / 11 known-bad.

      M3  neuter only the audit-side `render_sha256` comparison
          -> **24 / 1**: only `t_kb_mfresh_audit_render_rewritten`.
    Restored: 25 / 0 / 11. M3 is the one that matters most — it proves the
