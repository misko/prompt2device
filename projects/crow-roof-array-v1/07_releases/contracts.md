# contract: 07_releases/

sourcing_authority: jlc-pcba

**Purpose** — one immutable directory per **reviewed PCB release candidate**.
It answers, forever: *what exact design and fabrication payload was sealed,
what evidence admitted it, and was it orderable at that moment?* If the
candidate is later ordered, a separate order receipt binds the uploader event
to this exact immutable release; the release is never rewritten to imply that
an order occurred.

**A release is a COMPLETE, SELF-CONTAINED ARCHIVE.** Not a pointer to a git
SHA. The `git_sha` proves provenance; it must not be the only way to see what
was built. A release that contains gerbers but not the `.kicad_sch`/`.kicad_pcb`
they came from cannot be inspected, diffed, or rebuilt without checking out a
commit, resolving a toolchain, and re-running a pipeline — which is exactly
what nobody can do three years later when a board comes back wrong. The
archive must stand alone.

**Mutability** — the candidate path is mutable only during the normative
staging procedure below. The seal commit is the transition: from that commit
on, the release directory is **IMMUTABLE**. It is never re-exported into,
"refreshed", or tidied after sealing. ONE exception: when a later release
supersedes it, a single new file `SUPERSEDED.md` may be ADDED (never editing
anything that exists) naming the successor directory and the one-line reason.

**Immutability is UNCHANGED by the completeness requirement below.** The
self-contained-archive structure applies to **NEW** releases, from
2026-07-20 forward. Existing sealed releases are **NOT** retro-filled, not
reorganized into the new layout, and not "upgraded" — they are historical
facts about what was historically sealed or sent, and a directory that gains files after the fact
is no longer evidence of anything. A board that wants the fuller archive
gets a **NEW version**, and the old one gains only its `SUPERSEDED.md`
pointer. These two rules do not conflict: completeness governs what you
write at seal time; immutability governs everything after.

## Why this folder exists

One real project used a single mutable `fab/` directory and re-exported into
it ~15 times in a day. A KiCad version change renamed the inner-layer gerbers
(`.g2/.g3` → `.g1/.g2`), so stale KiCad-7 files sat mixed with KiCad-10 files
and a naive zip shipped **both**. The export script grew a stale-file warning
— a workaround for a structural problem. An immutable per-candidate release
directory makes the failure impossible instead of detectable. An order system
can then bind one uploader event to one release identity without changing it.

## Allowed — the complete archive (REQUIRED for new releases)

Machine-readable patterns (contracts_audit; the tree below is the human view):

| Pattern | What |
|---|---|
| `contracts.md` | this file |
| `<version>-<date>/MANIFEST.txt` `<version>-<date>/ORDER_README.md` `<version>-<date>/SUPERSEDED.md` | release root documents |
| `<version>-<date>/fab/**` | gerber zip, drill, bom.csv, cpl.csv |
| `<version>-<date>/pdf/**` | schematic (tscircuit's own render), pcb_layers, assembly |
| `<version>-<date>/source/**` | the EXACT source artifacts incl. fp-lib-table + vendored `.pretty` (V-REL-FPLIB, usb-hub-3s 2026-07-21: without them a standalone archive re-measure raises lib_footprint_issues — the archive must re-measure DRC clean) |
| `<version>-<date>/3d/**` | STEP/GLTF |
| `<version>-<date>/verification/**` | every gate's evidence |


### The directory NAME is how a machine tells the boards apart

Two release-name shapes are valid: bare `v<N>[.<N>…]-<YYYY-MM-DD>` and, when a project builds
more than one board, per-board `<board>-v<N>[.<N>…]-<YYYY-MM-DD>`
(`cooksense-v1.4-2026-07-26`). **`<board>` MUST be the `04_kicad` board stem**
(separator style and case are free: `crow_recorder_central_v2` and
`crow-recorder-central-v2` are the same board). This is not cosmetic — it is
the only thing that says which board a sealed archive belongs to.

- **A MULTI-BOARD project MUST use the per-board form for every release**,
  including the first. A bare name in a multi-board `07_releases/` is
  unattributable and every gate that resolves "this board's latest release"
  REFUSES it (`release_index.py`, canon M-COVER) rather than guessing.
- **Versions order NUMERICALLY PER COMPONENT**: `v1.10 > v1.9 > v1.2`. Never
  sort these names as text, and never re-implement the ordering — import
  `jlcpcb-fab/scripts/release_index.py`, which is its one home.
- **"The latest release" means the newest of THIS BOARD's series**, never the
  last directory in `07_releases/`. `smc0985-cooksense` holds `cooksense-*`
  and `interposer-*`; `interposer-…` sorts last, and a gate taking `rels[-1]`
  graded the interposer while reporting on cooksense, then demanded
  `SUPERSEDED.md` on the live `cooksense-v1.4` and blocked its successor
  (2026-07-27).
- `SUPERSEDED.md` is a WITHIN-SERIES claim: it is owed by this board's earlier
  releases, never by a sibling board's.

Nothing else. No working files, no "v2" of a release, no edits.

**The completeness test** — a release passes only if someone with this
directory, KiCad, and no network can: open the board, read the schematic,
check mechanical fit, see every gate's evidence, and re-plot the gerbers.
`source/` is what makes that true; `git_sha` only proves where it came from.

**Where the files come from.** `source/` is a COPY of the exact current
`04_kicad/` board + schematic selected at seal time, the
`03_tscircuit/src/<board>.tsx`, and the exported
netlist — copied at seal time, never symlinked (a symlink into a mutable
folder defeats the entire archive). For a tscircuit-authored board the
schematic PDF is copied from `03_tscircuit/build/schematic.pdf`.

### `DESIGN:` and `SOURCING:` — a seal makes TWO claims (canon A-BUY)

`DESIGN: PASS|FAIL` and `SOURCING: CLEAR|PLANNED-<n>|BLOCKED-<n>` are both
printed by `release_freshness_check.py` and both stamped here. They are
separate because they are answered by different authorities at different
times: design gates at SEAL time, JLCPCB allocation at ORDER time. Catalog
stock remains advisory. Every other
gate in this repo grades an artifact WE CONTROL, so a red means "there exists
an edit to this design that turns it green"; **J-PCBA-FINAL grades the current
assembly allocation**, and no edit to the design changes that warehouse state.

- **A release may seal with `DESIGN: PASS` + `SOURCING: PLANNED-<n>` or
  `BLOCKED-<n>`. It may NEVER seal with `DESIGN: FAIL`.**
- `PLANNED` means the plan makes the catalog irrelevant for that line
  (consignment, self-supply); `BLOCKED` means it cannot be bought as sealed.
  The classification is `order_status:` on the `03_src/rules/assembly.yaml`
  `sourcing_plan:` entry, and it is REQUIRED whenever the entry's own
  `measured_stock` does not cover `qty x build_quantity`. **An unclassified
  shortfall is a FAIL** — before this it cleared the line SILENTLY whatever
  its own number said, so a release could seal unbuyable with nothing
  anywhere saying so.
- **A BLOCKED release seals only OUT LOUD.** Both this MANIFEST and the FIRST
  SCREEN (40 lines) of `ORDER_README.md` must carry the gate line

      SOURCING: BLOCKED-<n> (<lcsc codes>; measured <YYYY-MM-DD>)

  and its status, count, LCSC set and date are compared against the
  measurement **in BOTH directions** — a release may neither hide a blocked
  line nor invent one. The date is the newest blocking `measured_on` and may
  not predate the release by more than 7 days: a stock reading is perishable,
  and an undated one is not evidence.
- **Order-time re-grade.** A sealed archive is immutable, so the sourcing
  question is re-asked from OUTSIDE it with an exact allocation receipt:
  `release_freshness_check.py <release_dir> --claim sourcing
  --sourcing-authority jlc-pcba --pcba-evidence
  FRESH.json`. A measurement POSTDATING the seal is reported, never failed —
  an archive cannot declare a fact discovered after it was written, and
  demanding it would be the retro-fill this contract forbids.

### `not_assembled:` is a REQUIRED, GENERATED block

**Required** whenever the board has any unpopulated non-exempt part,
**GENERATED from `03_src/rules/assembly.yaml`** — never hand-written — and a
BARE REFDES LIST, never prose. Reasons belong in `assembly.yaml`; a line
carrying free text is reported as UNGRADEABLE and cross-checked against
nothing, because scraping refdes out of prose accuses the wrong parts
(usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.4: 50 tokens, 44 of them English words, and its four real
refdes sit in a clause saying they *are* populated). It was a
prose sentence in two places and the two drifted: cooksense v1.1's MANIFEST
declared 12 refs not_assembled while its own CPL told JLC to place all 12, and
a 13th (J_TC) was declared nowhere. `assembly_coverage.py` (A-POP) FAILs both
the absence and any disagreement with `assembly.yaml`.

Each ref traces to an `assembly.yaml` entry whose `reason:` is the CLOSED
vocabulary — `not_in_catalog` · `user_supplied` · `dnp_by_design` ·
`mechanical` · `test_point` — with a DATED `evidence:` measurement (the
catalog query and its result) and a `disposition:`. `consign` is NOT a
population reason: a consigned part is POPULATED, stays ON the CPL, and
belongs in the `consigned:` MANIFEST line above (crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.3
declared its placed U1 "not_assembled" that way). The `msl:` line is REQUIRED
for every consigned part and every exposed-pad package — JLC cannot bake what
they are not told is moisture-sensitive (crow-recorder-central v1.0 shipped a
consigned MSL-3 XU316 with zero MSL text while its own part.yaml recorded
"MSL 3, 168h floor life").

`git_sha` + `git_dirty: false` is the load-bearing pair for PROVENANCE: it says
where the release came from. The sha256 table over **every** file is the
load-bearing pair for INTEGRITY: it says the archive still is what was sealed.
A release needs both — provenance without a complete archive is a promise you
can only cash by rebuilding the past. A separate order receipt is required to
prove that these exact bytes were later sent.

### `git_dirty` — scoped to the release's INPUTS, not the whole repo

`git_dirty` records whether the artifacts this release regenerates from were
committed at `git_sha`. Those inputs are exactly the board's own project
subtree and the shared skill backend — nothing else feeds the fab set:

    the release is CLEAN  iff  `git status --porcelain -- projects/<board>/ skills/`  is empty

A dirty SIBLING project (a concurrently-building board) has ZERO bearing on
THIS release's reproducibility and MUST NOT block the seal. A dirty `skills/`
backend, or a dirty / untracked file inside this board's own subtree, DOES
block — those are the inputs the gerbers are reproducible from. (This replaced
a repo-wide `git status --porcelain` that blocked a seal on unrelated sibling
dirt, forcing pause-coordination between independent boards — 2026-07-23.) The
board's own `07_releases/`, `06_build/`, `01_docs/` sit inside the in-scope
subtree and are checked: the seal commits the board's own artifacts first, so
at `git_sha` the whole subtree is committed-clean; only OTHER boards are exempt.

The MANIFEST records the flag WITH its scope noted, so no reader mistakes it
for a whole-repo claim:

    git_dirty:    false                   # scope: projects/<board>/ + skills/

**Helper (declared here):** `skills/kicad-pcb/scripts/release_git_dirty.py
"$PWD"` computes this scoped flag from the project root, prints the exact
MANIFEST line above, and
exits non-zero when dirty — the seal calls it and gates on the exit code
rather than eyeballing `git status`.

## Seal procedure (normative — the 2-commit seal)

The ONE home for HOW a release is cut; SKILL.md stage 7, the revision
CHECKLIST, and ORCHESTRATION_STATE.md all point HERE (single-homed
2026-07-23 — before that the dance lived only in one board's journal and
was re-derived per seal). The staging boundary carries the immutability
rule: the release directory is MUTABLE STAGING until the seal commit
lands; **immutability begins the moment the seal commit exists.**

Before step 0, use `skills/pcb-design/scripts/release_rehearsal.py init` to
create the DRAFT declaration consumed by staging gates. After the archive is
complete and all reviews are present, `release_rehearsal.py rehearse` must be
`ACCEPTED` on the exact staged bytes and `release_rehearsal.py seal` must emit
current seal admission. These commands neither commit nor replace the numbered
procedure below.

0. **Stage.** Write the complete archive into `07_releases/<ver>-<date>/`.
   Run EVERY gate and review against this staging dir — DRC/ERC/parity,
   twin, policy_audit, freshness, semantic M-BOM, and the review lenses
   (breadth per canon "Verification scoping": initial release = full
   battery; fix-pass = diff-verified delta + targeted confirms + ONE
   integrated fresh-context lens). **A finding here costs an edit; the
   same finding after the seal costs a supersede** (3 of one family's 4
   seals died to post-ceremony reviews, mean seal lifetime 5.6h,
   2026-07-23). Do not proceed with any open P0 or FAIL.
   **"FAIL" HERE MEANS `DESIGN: FAIL`, NOT `SOURCING: BLOCKED`** (canon
   A-BUY). A release whose only red is that a vendor is out of stock is
   SEALABLE — declare it per the `DESIGN:`/`SOURCING:` section above and
   proceed. Nine successive agents declined to seal a board at DRC 0/0/0
   and `policy_audit` FAIL=0 because the gate had one verdict for two
   questions, and each of them spent a full pass rediscovering why. Grade
   the claims separately when you need to:
   `release_freshness_check.py <staging_dir> --claim design`.
1. **Source commit S.** Commit every INPUT: the board's own subtree and
   any `skills/` changes. `release_git_dirty.py "$PWD"` must report
   clean apart from the staged release dir itself (the release dir is
   OUTPUT — the seal commit will carry it; any OTHER dirt blocks). Strip
   kicad-cli droppings LAST — any board-open regenerates gitignored
   `*.kicad_prl` / stray `*.kicad_pcb.kicad_pro` files, so the
   `git check-ignore` sweep is the FINAL pre-seal check (bit two boards,
   2026-07-23).
2. **Stamp.** Write `git_sha: S`, `git_dirty: false` into `MANIFEST.txt`
   and (re)compute its sha256 table over every file (MANIFEST itself is
   the one exclusion — it cannot hash itself). THEN re-run `policy_audit`
   M-REL and `release_freshness_check.py` so the shipped audit grades the
   REAL manifest (the v1.2 audit-vs-manifest disagreement class).
   `release_freshness_check.py` also gates MANIFEST SELF-CONSISTENCY
   (M-CONS, check d): every count the MANIFEST's gate summary states must
   match the shipped machine evidence (ERC errors/warnings vs the
   policy_audit S-ERC row and erc.json; bom_source_check line count vs
   fab/bom.csv data rows), and every `07_releases/<dir>/` path embedded in
   verification evidence must name THIS release's directory (or an
   existing sibling — diffing a real predecessor is legitimate). Re-run it
   after the stamp — the crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.0 class (2026-07-23)
   shipped prose counts and a staging path no gate compared. The gate's
   version key covers board-prefixed release names (`<board>-v1.x-<date>`)
   — before 2026-07-24 those silently skipped the stale-artifact check.
3. **Seal commit.** A commit that adds ONLY the release directory, the
   `01_docs/CHANGELOG.md` entry, and `SUPERSEDED.md` on the predecessor.
   From this commit on the directory is IMMUTABLE.
4. **Refresh the beacon — the seal is not complete without it (canon
   M-BEACON).** OVERWRITE `01_docs/STATUS*.md` (the board's own, on a
   multi-board project) so that `step:` names the release just created,
   `state:` is `done`, and `updated:` is now; then run
   `status_beacon_check.py <project>` and require exit 0. The beacon is the
   coordinator's only between-gates eye and it does not go blank when it goes
   stale — it keeps reporting the PREVIOUS release as live, with a plausible
   `sealed / done`. Measured 2026-07-27, before this step existed: EVERY
   beacon in the fleet named a superseded release (13 M-BEACON findings across
   4 of 6 boards), and one had a whole second frame APPENDED into a file this
   contract says is OVERWRITTEN. This step is where that class is closed —
   the gate catches drift AFTER the fact; the ritual is what prevents it.
   It comes AFTER the seal commit deliberately: the release directory it must
   name does not exist until then. Commit the refreshed beacon with the next
   working commit (it is `01_docs/` working state, never part of the sealed
   archive, and it must NEVER be added to the release directory).

5. **Gate publication.** A seal is necessary but publication still grades the
   repository delta: before a material PCB project reaches the publication
   branch, run `python3 skills/pcb-design/scripts/pcb_publication_gate.py
   --base <publication-branch-base-sha> --head <candidate-head-sha>`. Require
   `P-PUBLISH PASS`. The gate binds live board bytes, MANIFEST source commit,
   both existing release gates, and all four archived exact-artifact reviews.
   Branch protection must require this check and a PR; an after-push workflow
   cannot prevent a direct push to an unprotected branch.

**Docs-only supersede mode.** When the new release changes ONLY
documentation (dispositions, README, MANIFEST — no fab/source/3d delta),
gate the staging with `release_freshness_check.py <release_dir>
--docs-only-supersede <prior-release-dir>`: fab/, source/ and 3d/ must be
BYTE-IDENTICAL to the prior release (any differing/missing/added file
FAILS — it is not docs-only), identical pdf/ is allowed, and the order
README + MANIFEST must byte-differ (otherwise the release supersedes
nothing). The audit/manifest-agreement and draft-marker checks still run.
Never waive fab-identical files one-by-one for this case — the mode
asserts the identity instead of flagging it.

**BOM-only supersede mode.** The one case docs-only mode correctly refuses:
the copper is untouched but the ASSEMBLY BOM must lose rows, because canon
A-POP requires an unplaced part to LEAVE the BOM rather than sit on it
uncoded. Gate it with `--bom-only-supersede <prior-release-dir>`, which is
docs-only PLUS an exemption for exactly one file, `fab/bom.csv` — and only
because the mode then asserts something STRONGER about that file than
identity: the delta must be **whole rows REMOVED, for designators that are
NOT on the CPL**. A row ADDED, a row EDITED (a changed value/footprint/LCSC
is a different board), or a removal for a designator still on the CPL all
FAIL. Everything else in `fab/`, and all of `source/` and `3d/`, must still
be byte-identical. Motivating case: crow-mic-pod-v2 v1.0 (2026-07-25) shipped
MK1 with its MPN *and* LCSC columns both empty and J1 at stock 0, neither on
the CPL — the upload stalls at JLC's BOM/CPL matcher, and fixing it changes
`fab/`, so a plain docs-only claim would have been a lie. Do NOT reach for
`--allow-identical` waivers here; the point is to assert the shape of the
change, not to excuse it.

**LEGIBLE-BOM supersede mode.** The case all three modes above correctly
refuse. Canon **F-LEGIBLE** (ADR-0006): the copper is untouched but
`fab/bom.csv` must be rewritten so the RECIPIENT can PARSE it — MPN filled
from the part's own `02_parts/<MPN>/part.yaml` (then the vetted passives
ledger), a Comment that is a human-readable value instead of an LCSC code or
a `simple_*` generator placeholder, and a UTF-8 byte-order-mark so a cp936
reader cannot render `Ω` as `惟`. That EDITS every row, so docs-only
refuses (fab/ changed) and BOM-only refuses too — rightly, since it FAILs on
any edited row for the A-POP defect IT guards. Gate it with
`--legible-bom-supersede <prior-release-dir>`: docs-only PLUS an exemption
for exactly `fab/bom.csv`, and the mode then asserts something STRONGER than
identity about it — **every row's designator group, `Footprint` and `LCSC`
UNCHANGED; no row added or removed; no MPN blanked; only `Comment` and `MPN`
may move** — and, taken from the F-LEGIBLE gate itself rather than
re-implemented, **this release's BOM must PASS `bom_legibility_check.py` and
the prior one must FAIL it**. A changed `LCSC` is a SUBSTITUTION (the
C82317 → C131025 class) and FAILs; a changed `Footprint` is a different
board and FAILs. Motivating case: crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.5 (2026-07-27)
— its BOM was uploaded to JLCPCB and the parts "were not being picked up by
their web processing".

**SOURCING supersede mode.** The case ALL FOUR modes above correctly
refuse, and the one that had to be built twice before it was built once
(canon **M8**, two-strike promotion). JLC will not SUPPLY a line: the part
is at stock 0 at the order quantity, or the uploader returns a shortfall.
The fix substitutes an electrically identical part **at source** and moves
no copper — `MPN` and `LCSC` change together on the affected rows and
nothing else in the payload changes at all. docs-only refuses (fab/
changed), cpl-only permits only coordinates, bom-only permits only row
REMOVAL, and legible-bom explicitly FAILs a changed LCSC (correctly — when
it was written, a changed LCSC could only be the C82317 → C131025
accident). Gate it with `--sourcing-supersede <prior-release-dir>`, which
asserts, none of it waivable:

- the `source/*.kicad_pcb` is **md5-IDENTICAL** and the hash is PRINTED;
- `fab/cpl.csv` is **byte-identical** — a substitution moves no placement,
  so an unchanged CPL is what makes "drop-in" mean something;
- every gerber and drill is identical after stripping **only the plot's own
  timestamps** (`%TF.CreationDate`, `G04 Created by`, the Excellon date
  line and its `; #@! TF.CreationDate` twin) — so a **RE-PLOT from this
  release's own board is ACCEPTED**, which is stronger evidence than a
  byte-copy, and any other difference is copper;
- `fab/bom.csv` keeps its **row count and its designator groups in the same
  order**, and the ONLY cells permitted to move are `MPN` + `LCSC`,
  together, on the substituted rows. A `Comment` or `Footprint` change
  FAILs; an `MPN` moving where the `LCSC` did not FAILs and is redirected
  to `--legible-bom-supersede`;
- no substituted row is left with a blank `MPN` or a blank/malformed
  `LCSC`, and the new BOM **PASSES `bom_legibility_check`** (taken from the
  F-LEGIBLE gate itself, not re-implemented — ONE grader, canon M1);
- a `source/*.tsx` **CHANGED** (canon M3): a `fab/bom.csv` that moved
  without its source is a HAND-EDITED BOM, the defect crow-mic-pod-v2 paid
  for on 2026-07-27;
- and **BOTH codes of every substitution are NAMED in MANIFEST.txt or the
  order README**, so the diff is auditable by someone who was not here.

Motivating cases: usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.11 (2026-07-27) sealed this exact shape
gated by **SEVEN individually-measured file waivers** because the mode did
not exist — weaker evidence than the release it superseded, since every one
of those measurements is machine-checkable; and crow-recorder-central-v2
v1.7 (`C25767` → `C138030`, 220 kΩ at `R_vb1`, stock 0 at the 5-board
quantity), the second board, which is what makes promotion mandatory. Do
NOT reach for `--allow-identical` waivers here: an assertion the gate makes
beats a waiver a human writes.

**VALUE-CHANGE supersede mode.** The case ALL FIVE modes above correctly
refuse, and the one where "no copper moved" and "BOM only" come apart. A part
VALUE changes on parts that are ALREADY PLACED (22 kΩ → 33 kΩ on an existing
0603). Gate it with `--value-change-supersede <prior-release-dir>
--designators R4,R5`.

Measured on crow-mic-pod-v2 v1.3, 2026-07-28: `export_jlc_package.py` reads
`val = fp.GetValue()` **from the board** and feeds that ONE string to BOTH the
BOM `Comment` column and the CPL `Val` column. So a pure value change moves
the `.kicad_pcb`, the `.kicad_sch`, the `.net`, the BOM rows for those refs
and exactly their CPL `Val` cells — while **all 11 gerbers and drills are
byte-identical** (11/11, the method validated by re-plotting the sealed v1.3
fab set from its own archived board). docs-only refuses (fab/ changed);
bom-only refuses (it permits only row REMOVAL, and only for refs NOT on the
CPL — these ARE on it); legible-bom refuses (a changed LCSC is a substitution
to it); sourcing refuses (it demands an md5-identical board and a
byte-identical CPL, and a value change moves both); and cpl-only names a
`Val` change as its own explicit exclusion. Without this mode the only way to
seal a copper-identical value fix is to hand-edit a CSV, which canon M3
forbids. The mode asserts, none of it waivable:

- **the COPPER did not move**: every gerber and drill identical after
  stripping only the plot's own timestamps (`%TF.CreationDate`, `G04 Created
  by`, the Excellon `; DRILL file … date` line and its `; #@! TF.CreationDate`
  twin) — so a **RE-PLOT from this release's own board is ACCEPTED**, which is
  stronger evidence than a byte-copy, and anything else is copper. A release
  with no gerber/drill on both sides cannot make the claim and FAILs;
- **the SOURCE moved**, in the direction canon M3 requires here: both
  `source/*.kicad_pcb` and `source/*.kicad_sch` CHANGED, with both md5s
  PRINTED. A value lives in those files, so unchanged source means a
  HAND-EDITED CSV. Editing the board alone is not a way out — measured, that
  leaves `kicad-cli pcb drc --schematic-parity` reporting
  `footprint_symbol_mismatch` on exactly those refs;
- **the CPL delta is `Val` cells and NOTHING else**: identical row count,
  identical designator sequence, and for every ref the coordinate, rotation,
  layer and package unchanged. A moved coordinate is `--cpl-only-supersede`'s
  defect (A-POS) and a moved rotation is A-ROT's; neither rides along here;
- **every moved cell belongs to a DECLARED designator.** `--designators` is
  REQUIRED (an empty confinement list confines nothing, so the mode refuses to
  run) and must be neither too narrow nor too WIDE: a change touching an
  undeclared ref FAILs, and a declared ref that moved nothing FAILs too;
- **the BOM ref set is FROZEN.** Rows may split or merge around the new values
  — the exporter groups by `(code, val, footprint)` — but no designator may be
  added or dropped (that is A-POP's business and `--bom-only-supersede`'s
  mode), and a declared ref's `Footprint` may not move;
- **a declared ref's `LCSC` MUST move with its value.** A different value is a
  different part: a row whose `Comment` claims the new value against the OLD
  part's code is the R12/R30 wrong-part class verbatim, and it is exactly what
  a board-only edit produces;
- **the two artifacts AGREE** — each declared ref's new CPL `Val` appears as a
  token in its own BOM `Comment` (one merged `a / b` Comment is written when
  two values share a code+footprint, so containment is the honest form). They
  come from ONE `GetValue()` call; a disagreement is positive evidence that
  one CSV was written by hand;
- the new BOM **PASSES `bom_legibility_check`** (from the F-LEGIBLE gate
  itself, never re-implemented — ONE grader, canon M1), so a new value with no
  vetted ledger row or `02_parts` dossier blocks;
- and **BOTH the old and the new value of every declared designator are NAMED
  in `MANIFEST.txt` or the order README**, so the reason this release exists
  is legible to someone who was not here.

This mode is the FIRST of the six built proactively rather than after a seal
paid for its absence, and that is recorded deliberately: canon M8 promotes on
the second strike, so a one-strike build is an exception, taken because the
measurement (11/11 gerbers, the `fp.GetValue()` single-source finding) already
existed and the alternative shape — individually-measured file waivers — is
the exact weaker-evidence pattern M8 condemns. crow-mic-pod-v2 itself took a
firmware-side fix and sealed nothing; this gate is for the fleet's next value
change. Do NOT reach for `--allow-identical` waivers here.

**CPL-only supersede mode.** When the new release changes ONLY
`fab/cpl.csv` — a PLACEMENT fix — gate the staging with
`release_freshness_check.py <release_dir> --cpl-only-supersede
<prior-release-dir>`: everything else in `fab/`, and all of `source/` and
`3d/`, must be BYTE-IDENTICAL, and the CPL delta must be coordinate moves
and/or whole rows REMOVED for parts that are no longer populated. A
ROTATION, `Layer`, `Val` or `Package` change FAILs, and so does an ADDED
row, and so does a CPL that did not change at all (that is a docs-only
supersede). This exists because a wrong CPL coordinate is the one defect
that is 100% assembly data and 0% copper: crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.4
shipped its only USB-C 1.3025mm off its own pads (canon A-POS — the
exporter emitted KiCad's footprint ANCHOR, not JLC's pad-array datum),
and fixing it changes exactly one file. Keeping rotation OUT of this mode
is load-bearing: the v1.3 -> v1.4 supersede was ALSO a CPL-only change and
it moved seven ROTATIONS, so without the split the two defect classes
would share one unaccountable channel.

Deviations that force rework (both happened, 2026-07-23): regenerating ANY
artifact after S makes S stale — return to step 1 with a new S. Committing
the staged release INSIDE the source commit (usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.3 gate-ii)
leaves MANIFEST pointing at an older sha and forces a follow-up re-stamp
commit + `policy_audit --skip-drc` re-clear — legal but three commits
instead of two; follow the order above. The orchestrator's INDEPENDENT
re-measure after sealing is ORCHESTRATION_STATE.md "Seal-verify protocol".

## Fix-claim evidence rule

A release whose MANIFEST claims a FIX or verification refresh relative to a
prior release must carry, in `verification/`, the MEASUREMENT that proves
that specific claim (numbers + method + what was measured), by a method
able to FALSIFY it independently of whoever produced the fix (render
before/after diff, landmark-calibrated pixels, or a fresh-context agent
confirming the specific claim). A refresh once shipped claiming a model
re-seated when the nudge had moved it 90deg the wrong way — checker and
checked shared a method.

## Forbidden

- **Generators writing here.** They write `04_kicad/` and `06_build/` only.
- Editing any file in a release directory after it is written. If something
  is wrong, cut a NEW release; the wrong one is a historical fact.
- Releasing with dirty INPUTS (`git_dirty: true`) — a dirty `skills/` backend
  or a dirty/untracked file in the board's own subtree. Scope is
  `projects/<board>/ + skills/`, NOT the whole repo: a dirty SIBLING project
  does not block (`release_git_dirty.py "$PWD"` computes it from the project
  root).
- A release whose required **design** gates failed or whose required evidence
  is incomplete. `verification/` holds those receipts. A classified sourcing
  block is different: it permits only the loud `DO-NOT-ORDER` seal described
  below.
- **A release carrying an unresolved P0 red-team finding.** A P0 blocks the
  release — fix and re-gate, or supersede; it may not seal open.
- **A CPL row whose BOM line has a BLANK LCSC** (canon A-POP). JLC is being
  told to place a part it has no code to source. An uncoded line is a FAILED
  sourcing decision: it needs an `assembly.yaml` entry with a
  closed-vocabulary `reason:` and dated `evidence:`, AND the part must leave
  the CPL (`exclude_from_pos_files` on the board).
- **Sealing against stock evidence with no parseable verdict or no explicit
  disposition** (canon A-STOCK). Every shortage must be classified by a dated
  `sourcing_plan:` as `PLANNED` or `BLOCKED`; an unclassified shortage fails.
  A classified `BLOCKED` result may seal the design only with the loud
  `SOURCING: BLOCKED-<n>` declarations below, and it cannot be ordered.
- **Sealing a NON-ORDERABLE release QUIETLY** (canon A-BUY). Sealing one is
  PERMITTED — `DESIGN: PASS` + `SOURCING: BLOCKED-<n>` is a consistent state,
  and refusing it is what cost smc0985-cooksense v1.7 nine seals on a board
  with zero design defects. What is forbidden is a `sourcing_plan:` shortfall
  with no `order_status:` classification, and a BLOCKED measurement that does
  not appear — with its count, its LCSC codes and its date — in BOTH the
  MANIFEST and the first screen of `ORDER_README.md`. Equally forbidden in
  the other direction: DECLARING a blocked line the evidence does not
  measure. A release may neither hide one nor invent one.
- **Sealing with `design_verdict: DEFECTIVE`** on either red-team lens
  (canon M-REV). The verdict split adds a dimension; it adds no way past a
  design-side red. `order_verdict: DO-NOT-ORDER` blocks the ORDER, not the
  seal — but only once it has been re-graded honestly: if the reason is
  SOURCING and the design is sound, the lens has the vocabulary to say so
  (`design_verdict: SOUND` + `order_verdict: BLOCKED-SOURCING`).
- **A release that outsources its own contents to git.** No `source/` means
  no release — "it's at that SHA" is not an archive. Likewise no symlinks
  into `04_kicad/` or `03_tscircuit/`; those folders keep moving.
- **Retro-filling a sealed release** to satisfy the completeness structure.
  Cut a new version with a `SUPERSEDED.md` on the old one instead.

## Validate

- directory name matches `^v[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$`
- `MANIFEST.txt` and `ORDER_README.md` present
- **every file in the directory appears in the MANIFEST sha256 table, and
  every sha256 matches** — both directions. A file not in the table is
  unaccounted-for; a table entry with no file is a missing artifact.
  (`MANIFEST.txt` itself is the one exclusion — it cannot hash itself.)
- `git_dirty: false` — scope `projects/<board>/ + skills/` (a dirty sibling
  project does not count); compute with `release_git_dirty.py "$PWD"` from the
  project root
- `git_sha` exists in this repo's history
- **`fab/`, `pdf/`, `source/`, `verification/` all present and non-empty**
  (new releases); `3d/` present or its absence explained in the MANIFEST
- exactly one gerber zip in `fab/`; the BOM/CPL are siblings, **not inside**
  the zip (fab uploads them separately)
- `source/` opens: `kicad-cli pcb drc --severity-all --refill-zones --schematic-parity --exit-code-violations source/<board>.kicad_pcb` runs, and the
  board it loads is the one the gerbers were plotted from — re-plot from
  `source/` and the gerbers match
- `source/<board>.net` is node-for-node identical to the netlist the exact
  `04_kicad` snapshot produced at `git_sha`
- `verification/` reports show passing gates: DRC 0/0/0, ERC 0 errors,
  parity 0, audit PASS, policy_audit 0 FAIL (incl. M-BOM: fab BOM LCSC ==
  source per refdes), twin/pin/render reviews PASS
- **the ASSEMBLY battery on THIS release's own bytes (canon A-POP/A-STOCK —
  PCBA is the deliverable):**
  - `assembly_coverage.py <release_dir>` exits 0 — `{board} − {CPL}` equals
    `assembly.yaml`'s `not_assembled:` set, no blank-LCSC ref on the CPL, and
    the MANIFEST `not_assembled:` line matches `assembly.yaml`
  - `release_freshness_check.py <release_dir>` exits 0 including check (e):
    the sealed stock evidence carries a PARSEABLE verdict and every coded,
    placed line either clears `qty x build_quantity` or names a dated,
    explicitly classified `sourcing_plan:` entry
  - **and check (f) (canon A-BUY): every `sourcing_plan:` shortfall carries
    `order_status: PLANNED|BLOCKED`, and a release measured `BLOCKED-<n>`
    declares it — count, LCSC set and date all MATCHING the measurement — in
    the MANIFEST and in the first 40 lines of `ORDER_README.md`.** The gate
    prints `DESIGN:` and `SOURCING:` separately and `--claim design|sourcing`
    exit-codes them independently, so a sourcing red can no longer veto the
    design claim
  - **and check (g) (canon M-REV): both contract-named red-team lens files
    carry `design_verdict: SOUND`, and their `order_verdict` does not
    contradict the measured `SOURCING:` state in either direction.** A
    missing, prose-only or out-of-vocabulary verdict is a FAIL, never a skip
  - `bom_legibility_check.py <release_dir>` exits 0 (canon F-LEGIBLE) — every
    coded row carries an MPN that AGREES with its dossier, every Comment is a
    human-readable value, and the file decodes identically under UTF-8 and
    cp936. **Adopted-forward**: 25 of the 26 releases sealed before ADR-0006
    fail this and are NOT retro-fixed (07_releases immutability). A board that
    needs a legible BOM gets a NEW version; `fleet_regrade.py` says which
  - **AND it reports ZERO rows `not re-derivable from the shipped bytes`**
    (added 2026-07-29). Exit 0 is no longer sufficient, because F-LEGIBLE has a
    THIRD verdict — `F-LEGIBLE NOT FULLY GRADED
    [NOT-REDERIVABLE-FROM-SHIPPED-BYTES]`, which exits 0 by design: the rows are
    legible and no defect was found, but the two-path MPN AGREEMENT check could
    not be performed from anything the release carries. A release sealed in that
    state can never be graded again, and 07_releases immutability means it can
    never be repaired either. **The seal is the one moment the dossier tree is
    still live**, so full hand-verified coverage is required THERE and nowhere
    else. A row that can only be CORROBORATED by the release's own
    `stock_check.csv` still counts against this, because corroboration is
    existence and not agreement
- **ORDER-TIME ONLY — not a release-seal prerequisite:** the F-ECHO ritual
  (canon F-LEGIBLE, human-gated). The
  ORDER_README carries it beside the A-POL rotation-preview gate: after
  uploading `fab/bom.csv`, save JLC's OWN resolved/matched part table out of
  their UI and run `bom_legibility_check.py fab/bom.csv --echo SAVED.csv`
  against `bom_echo_gate.txt`. A code JLC redirects is a SUBSTITUTION and a
  FINDING to adjudicate BEFORE paying, never after. There is deliberately no
  JLCPCB API integration (ADR-0006): it would require handing over
  credentials, the same line already drawn on the Mouser/Nexar APIs
- red-team review present in `verification/` under the two contract-named
  files, both lenses' (topology/protection + layout/thermal)
  `design_verdict: SOUND`, zero unresolved P0 (a P0 blocks the release);
  archived verbatim in `08_reviews/`. `order_verdict` is graded too, against
  the SOURCING measurement rather than against the seal (canon M-REV)
- the bare/modeled render pair for both sides (`render_{top,bottom}_bare.png`
  beside the twin renders) and `missing_models.txt` are present in
  `verification/`; `missing_models.txt` carries the `GENERATED by jlc_twin`
  provenance line and a `bodies mounted: N/M` header with **N == M** (canon
  A-BODY). A missing or unparseable counter is a FAIL, not a skip
- `01_docs/CHANGELOG.md` has an entry whose `Released:` names this directory
- while this directory is the LIVE release (no `SUPERSEDED.md`), the board's
  `01_docs/STATUS*.md` beacon NAMES it and is not older than it —
  `status_beacon_check.py <project>` exits 0 (canon M-BEACON). The beacon is
  working state, not release content: it is refreshed by seal step 4 and never
  written into this directory

## Repair

- Missing MANIFEST → reconstruct ONLY if the git SHA is certain; otherwise
  mark the directory `UNVERIFIED-` and cut a fresh release. A release you
  cannot trace is worse than no release.
- sha256 mismatch → the directory was mutated after the fact. It is no longer
  evidence of anything. Rename to `TAINTED-<name>` and re-release.
- Someone re-exported into an existing release → same as above. The whole
  point is that this is detectable.
- **A sealed release predating the complete-archive rule** (no `source/`,
  no `3d/`, fab files loose at the root) → **leave it exactly as it is.**
  It is a valid historical release under the contract in force when it was
  sealed. Do NOT backfill. If the board needs the fuller archive, cut a new
  version from the current source and add `SUPERSEDED.md` to the old one
  naming it. Retro-editing would destroy the one property that makes any of
  these directories worth keeping.

## Compliance audit (design-policies.md IDs)

This folder answers **M5** (M-REL) and hosts the evidence for everything:

- MANIFEST `git_sha` is an EXACT commit hash that exists; `git_dirty:
  false` (scoped to `projects/<board>/ + skills/` via
  `release_git_dirty.py`, NOT the whole repo — a dirty sibling project does
  not block); every sha256 in the table verifies against the file beside it,
  and every file in the directory is in the table.
- The archive is SELF-CONTAINED: `fab/`, `pdf/`, `source/`, `verification/`
  present; `source/` holds the exact `.kicad_sch` / `.kicad_pcb` / `.tsx` /
  `.net` the fab set was produced from.
- `01_docs/CHANGELOG.md` has an entry naming this directory.
- Every superseded sibling carries `SUPERSEDED.md`.
- Any fix-claim in the MANIFEST has its falsifiable measurement IN
  `verification/` (checker and claimed-fixer must not share a method).
- `verification/policy_audit.md` ships in the bundle: zero FAIL, waivers
  evidence-backed, HUMAN items (S5/S6/S7, M1) carrying reviewer verdicts.

Audit: `policy_audit.py <project> [--board <04_kicad stem>]` runs M-REL
mechanically; a release cut with any policy FAIL is invalid (cut a new one
after the fix or waiver). **On a multi-board project `--board` is REQUIRED to
grade the second board** — the audit grades one board per run (the report's
header line names it), and M-REL/M-BOM/A-POP/A-BODY resolve the release from
THAT board's series.
