# contract: 08_reviews/

**Purpose** — the project's review record: every design review this board
receives — red-team release reviews, fresh-context pin/render verdicts,
EXTERNAL reviews (human or LLM) — archived VERBATIM with provenance, plus
the disposition ledger tracing every finding to its outcome. The most
consequential document a board ever receives is often a review; before this
folder existed, the review that forced usb-hub-3s v1.1 lived only in a chat
window (2026-07-21) — the knowledge-evaporation failure mode, review
edition.

**Mutability** — dated review files are APPEND-ONLY EVIDENCE (verbatim, never
paraphrased or edited — same discipline as BRIEF prompts; a wrong review is
dispositioned as refuted, not rewritten). Canonical `pre-route_*.md` files are
stage-gate evidence: when their exact artifact/rules hash becomes stale they
are replaced by a fresh review before work continues. `DISPOSITIONS.md` is the
mutable index.

## Allowed

| Pattern | What |
|---|---|
| `contracts.md` | this file |
| `DISPOSITIONS.md` | the living findings ledger — REQUIRED once any review exists |
| `first-picture_<date>.md` | early functional-skeleton readability record, created before detailed sourcing or PCB work; it binds the prototype PDF hash but is not a placement permission |
| `pre-route_topology.md` | schematic-phase PR-REVIEW witness bound to exact normalized netlist, parts and adopted design-rule hashes |
| `pre-route_schematic_render.md` | schematic-phase human-readability witness bound to the exact delivered PDF, normalized netlist, parts and adopted design-rule hashes |
| `pre-route_pin.md` | placement-phase physical-pin review bound to exact board, parts and adopted design-rule hashes |
| `pre-route_layout.md` | placement-phase layout review bound to exact board and adopted design-rule hashes |
| `pre-route_render.md` | placement-phase render review bound to exact board and adopted design-rule hashes |
| `rf_schematic.md` `rf_pcb.md` `rf_fab.md` | canonical independent RF witnesses bound to the exact schematic, board, or plotted-fab subject required by `rf.yaml` |
| `<date>_pre-D*.md` | immutable decision-delta review retained when a later directive supersedes the canonical witness |
| `<date>_<subject>_<source>_<lens>.md` | one review, verbatim (e.g. `2026-07-21_v1.0_redteam_topology.md`, `2026-07-21_v1.0_external-llm_full.md`) |
| `<date>_jlc-twin-render-review*.md` | bounded manufacturing-twin/render witness and exact-subject delta rechecks; each still carries the dated-review header and immutable artifact hashes |

## Early first-picture checkpoint

As soon as the functional skeleton exists, render the actual human PDF and
review it at normal viewing size before detailed sourcing or any PCB work. The
record names the PDF SHA-256, reviewer/context, and `SOUND|DEFECTIVE` verdict,
then comments on left-to-right functional flow, visible block headings, local
critical support circuits, important active-part identities, explained
intentional NCs, and page occupancy. Source section names and a drawing that is
readable only after deep zoom do not pass. This checkpoint prevents late
presentation backtracks; it does not replace the exact freeze review below.

## Dated/release review file structure

Header block, REQUIRED:

    subject: <project> <release-version-or-git-sha reviewed>
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    reviewer: <redteam-agent (model, lens) | external (who/what) | pin-review | render-review>
    context-given: <zero-context | release-archive-only | full-tree | unknown (external)>
    source_commit: <full git SHA reviewed>
    board_sha256: <SHA256 of the exact .kicad_pcb reviewed>
    design_verdict: <SOUND | DEFECTIVE>
    order_verdict:  <ORDER | DO-NOT-ORDER | BLOCKED-SOURCING>

Then the review body VERBATIM. For external reviews received through a
person, note the transmission path; never edit the content.

## Canonical pre-route review structure

`pre_route_review_check.py` owns these fail-closed fields. Every file carries
`review_stage: pre-route`, its exact `review_kind`, and
`design_verdict: SOUND|DEFECTIVE`. Schematic topology binds
`netlist_sha256`, `parts_sha256`, and (when adopted) `design_rules_sha256`.
Schematic render binds `schematic_pdf_sha256` plus the same normalized netlist,
parts and adopted-rule hashes as topology. Placement pin/layout/render bind
`board_sha256`; pin also binds `parts_sha256`, and all three bind adopted
`design_rules_sha256`. These are permissions to
spend on the next design stage, never order verdicts; an adjacent artifact or
rules edit makes the witness stale automatically.

### TWO verdict keys, because a seal makes TWO claims (canon M-REV)

A review used to carry ONE `verdict:` field, and it was asked to answer two
different questions at once:

| claim | the question | who can answer it | the key |
|---|---|---|---|
| *this design is correct* | may it SEAL? | the design gates + the lens, at SEAL time | `design_verdict` |
| *this design is orderable* | may it be BOUGHT today? | the CATALOG, at ORDER time | `order_verdict` |

`BLOCKED-SOURCING` exists precisely so a lens can say **"this board is right
and you cannot buy it today"** without either half contaminating the other.
The vocabularies are CLOSED and the value is read as DATA — the first token
after the colon. Prose is not a verdict: `VERDICT AT RUN TIME: **DO NOT
ORDER.**` states none, and is reported as stating none (crediting prose is
the R-LEN word-credit defect). A missing or out-of-vocabulary verdict is a
FAIL, never a skip.

**Which key each consumer reads:**

- the **seal gate** reads `design_verdict` — `DEFECTIVE` blocks the seal
  exactly as `DO-NOT-ORDER` always did. The split adds a dimension; it adds
  no way past a design-side red.
- the **ORDER_README** reads `order_verdict` — it is the buyer's document,
  and `DO-NOT-ORDER` / `BLOCKED-SOURCING` belong on its first screen beside
  the `SOURCING:` gate line (07_releases contract, canon A-BUY).

**LEGACY RETROFIT (non-breaking, and deliberately CONSERVATIVE).** Reviews
written before this split carry a single `verdict:`, and they map to BOTH
keys rather than being invalidated — 07_releases is immutable, so retro-
editing sealed archives to a new vocabulary is a retro-fill by another name:

| legacy `verdict:` | `design_verdict` | `order_verdict` |
|---|---|---|
| `ORDER` | SOUND | ORDER |
| `PASS` / `PASS-WITH-NOTES` | SOUND | *unstated* — a readability/pin verdict never asserted orderability |
| `DO-NOT-ORDER` / `FAIL` | DEFECTIVE | DO-NOT-ORDER |

A refusal stays a refusal: **no existing review is retroactively converted
into an acceptance.** The split gives the NEXT reviewer the vocabulary; it
does not re-adjudicate the last one. New reviews write both keys.

**WHY THIS COST A BOARD ITS SEAL.** smc0985-cooksense v1.7 reached DRC
0/0/0, `policy_audit` FAIL=0 and both red-team lenses graded, and its
topology re-gate wrote, verbatim: *"I would accept the seal ... **but
sealing is not the question this verdict field asks.** The question is
whether this release can be ordered, and it cannot."* The reviewer would
seal, the gate read `verdict:`, `verdict:` meant *orderable*, and eight
successive sealing passes declined. The lens and the gate did not disagree
about anything physical.

## DISPOSITIONS.md structure

One row per finding, across ALL reviews (the review-side decision
register):

    | id | review file | finding (one line) | severity | verification | disposition |

- `severity`: `P0` / `P1` / `P2` (SKILL.md stage 7) — a P0 blocks the
  release; a P1 lands in ORDER_README + the next-rev work order; a P2 is
  recorded. There is no other severity vocabulary.
- `verification`: findings are CLAIMS — each is independently verified
  against the artifacts (netlist/board/part.yaml) before disposition:
  `confirmed (evidence)` / `refuted (evidence)` / `unverifiable-here`.
- `disposition`: `fixed — <release/commit link>` / `deferred — <ADR /
  ORDER_README / next-rev work-order link>` (a P1 lands here) / `waived —
  <evidence>` / `recorded — <note>` (a P2 lands here) / `duplicate of <id>`.

## Gates

### Conditional RF review subpipeline

When `03_src/rules/rf.yaml` has `rf.enabled: true`, three additional reviews
are mandatory and independent of the general topology/layout lenses:

1. `RF_SCHEMATIC` before placement, following
   `rf-schematic-review-protocol.md`;
2. `RF_PCB` on the exact routed board before layout seal, following
   `rf-pcb-review-protocol.md`;
3. `RF_FAB` on the exact plotted Gerber/drill archive before prototype order,
   following `rf-fab-review-protocol.md`.

Each review path, artifact path, and non-empty requirement-ID set is declared
in `rf.yaml`. `rf_contract_check.py` derives coverage from `requirement: <ID>
PASS|FAIL` lines and verifies the artifact SHA; a typed count cannot create a
pass. RF fab readiness authorizes a prototype only. Production remains HOLD
until the declared first-article VNA/TDR acceptance measurements pass.

- **A release may not seal while any CONFIRMED P0 finding lacks a `fixed`
  disposition** (red-team stage, SKILL.md stage 7).
- **Per sealed release, BOTH red-team lenses must be present with a
  `design_verdict: SOUND`** — a `redteam` topology/protection/ratings-lens
  review AND a `redteam` layout/thermal/power-integrity-lens review file
  (reviewer: `redteam-agent` with the named lens), each carrying both
  verdict keys in its header block. `design_verdict: DEFECTIVE` blocks the
  seal until re-gated or superseded (SKILL.md stage 7).
- **Coverage is exact and fail-closed:** M-REV must grade 2/2 contract-named
  red-team files. Zero or one file is `REVIEW-COVERAGE` FAIL, never "nothing
  to grade". Publication additionally requires pin and render reviews, so the
  publication denominator is 4/4.
- Every release-used pin/render/topology/layout review binds the exact board
  through `board_sha256` (a markdown exact-artifact table is accepted for
  legacy render reviews), names this project in `subject`, and is byte-for-byte
  identical to an append-only `.md` archived here. A review of adjacent board
  bytes is not evidence for the released board.
- **`order_verdict` does NOT block the seal — it blocks the ORDER**, and it
  is cross-checked against the release's own shipped stock evidence in both
  directions (canon M-REV + A-BUY): a lens may not grade `ORDER` on a
  release measured `SOURCING: BLOCKED`, nor `BLOCKED-SOURCING` on one where
  every coded, placed line clears its build quantity. BLOCKED-SOURCING is a
  MEASUREMENT, not a mood, and an unfounded one costs the buyer a real
  order.
- The release's red-team reviews are written HERE first (the living
  tracked home) and COPIED into the release `verification/` as the sealed
  snapshot **under the two contract-named filenames** `redteam_topology.md`
  and `redteam_layout.md` — those exact names are what M-REV grades, and
  deliberately not a `redteam*.md` glob, because releases archive dated
  reviews of EARLIER versions beside them and grading a v1.0 review's
  verdict against a v1.12 release is the adjacent-property error.
- Audit: every `DISPOSITIONS.md` row links an existing review file; every
  review file has the header block; every P0/P1 row has a non-empty
  disposition; both red-team lenses present with `design_verdict: SOUND`.
  Machine check: **M-REV** (`release_freshness_check.py <release_dir>`
  check (g)) — the field the contract has demanded since it was written and
  that nothing parsed for its whole history. MEASURED 2026-07-30, with its
  denominator: of 33 sealed release dirs, 21 ship both named lens files, and
  **9 of those 21** carry an ungradeable verdict on at least one lens (5 with
  no verdict KEY at all, 8 with a value outside every vocabulary, overlap 4).
  Only 12 of 21 parse. The commonest defect is `verdict: DO NOT ORDER`
  written as prose after the colon — first token `DO`. cooksense v1.5's
  shipped `redteam_layout.md` does not use the key at all: line 5 reads
  `VERDICT AT RUN TIME: **DO NOT ORDER.**`, a sealed release carrying a
  DO-NOT-ORDER review nobody read. A prose rule eventually gets skipped
  (canon M2).
