# TEMPLATE rebuild_reuse.sh — the DETERMINISTIC route-authority rebuild driver
# (skill-owned; copy into a board's 03_src/ beside rebuild_all.sh — it is
# config-driven and needs NO per-board edits: the board name comes from
# 03_src/floorplan.yaml `project.name`, exactly like the generic backend).
#
# WHEN TO USE WHICH DRIVER
#   rebuild_all.sh    — the FULL pipeline from tscircuit source: tsci build ->
#                       converter .kicad_sch -> ERC/parity -> board -> route ->
#                       gates. Run it when the SCHEMATIC changed, or for the
#                       from-scratch reproducibility proof (canon M3).
#   rebuild_reuse.sh  — THIS driver: the per-iteration / verification rebuild.
#                       Skips the tsci stage entirely and regenerates the board
#                       from committed 03_src config + the PINNED, committed
#                       03_tscircuit/kicad/<board>.kicad_sch, importing the
#                       PROMOTED KRT chain. Every step is deterministic, so it
#                       reproduces the board's routing gate exactly.
#
# WHY THE SPLIT (2026-07-23, measured on crow-rv2 + usb-hub): `tsci build` is
# NON-DETERMINISTIC — rerunning it churns the generated .kicad_sch by ~2900
# lines of UUID/ordering noise (connectivity stays stable per count_parity,
# but kicad-cli's --schematic-parity then reports phantom field diffs against
# the sealed board). The COMMITTED .kicad_sch is therefore the PINNED canonical
# schematic: this driver never regenerates it, it consumes it. This pattern was
# independently rewritten by THREE boards (usb-hub-3s-v2/-v3 rebuild_fast.sh,
# crow-rv2 rebuild_reuse.sh) — an M8 two-strike violation this template retires.
#
# VALID ONLY while KRT-routed pins do NOT move. If a signal-carrying pad's
# placement changes, re-route KRT on a track-free board, re-promote the chain
# into 03_src/route/, and commit it (there is deliberately no autorouter here).
#
# Order is BINDING (03_src/contracts.md): rules BEFORE import (canon R1),
# generate_rules LAST again after stitch (pcbnew saves clobber netclasses),
# then the full gate: kicad-cli pcb drc --severity-all --refill-zones
# --schematic-parity --exit-code-violations 04_kicad/<board>.kicad_pcb = 0/0/0.
# The pinned .kicad_sch is copied beside the board
# first — without it --schematic-parity SILENTLY SKIPS (crow-rv2 finding).
