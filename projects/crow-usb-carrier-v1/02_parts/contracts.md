# contract: 02_parts/

**Purpose** — one directory per MPN actually used on the board, holding the
datasheet and the facts extracted from it. Makes the project standalone: a
clone with no network still knows every pad number, limit and polarity.

**Mutability** — append on part addition; edit a `part.yaml` only when the
datasheet REVISION changes.

## The three tiers (confusing them is the default mistake)

| Tier | Cost | Lifetime | Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| PDF blob | seconds | until vendor revises | global `~/.cache/datasheets/<sha256>.pdf` (never git) + a project copy HERE once used |
| Extracted facts | expensive, error-prone | until revision changes | `part.yaml`, committed |
| Stock / price | seconds | hours | `06_build/cache/`, TTL'd, **never** here |

**The download is not the expensive part — the extraction is.** Reading a
60-page datasheet to get physical pad numbers right is the costly work. Do it
once. A committed stock number is a lie within a day; a committed pad number
is true for the life of the revision.

## Flow

```
need a datasheet
  → global cache hit? yes: free. no: download, hash, store in cache
  → extract facts ONCE into 02_parts/<MPN>/part.yaml
  → is the part actually USED (in the schematic/BOM)?
      yes → copy the PDF from cache into 02_parts/<MPN>/ and commit
      no  → cache-only. Record WHY it lost in 01_docs/decisions/NNNN-*.md
```

Rejected candidates never get a committed PDF — the binary is worthless, the
reason is not. The global cache still means you never re-download while
iterating over alternatives.

## Allowed

| Pattern | What |
|---|---|
| `<MPN>/part.yaml` | the facts + provenance. Required for every used part |
| `<MPN>/<DOCID><REV>.pdf` | the datasheet. Filename carries the REVISION |
| `CL21A106KOCLRNC/CL21A106KOCLRN-20260922.html` | Exact retained Samsung manufacturer response containing embedded typical AC/DC characteristic datasets; URL/date/byte hash in the dossier notes. This evidence is a primary web export, not a manufacturer PDF or guaranteed curve. |
| `GRM32ER71A476KE15L/models/netlist-*.txt` | Retained Murata SimSurfing small-signal model text at named DC-bias/temperature conditions; evidence for independently reviewed source engineering estimates, not guaranteed production limits |
| `GRM32ER71A476KE15L/models/README.md` | Model acquisition, normalization, applicability, review and retained-file hash provenance |
| `<MPN>/notes.md` | optional: errata, application gotchas too long for `gotchas:` |
| `README.md` | folder status + **deviations register**: every departure from this contract (unfetchable PDF, series-sheet passives without PDFs), each with why + what must happen before bring-up | required if any deviation exists |
| `contracts.md` | this file |

`<MPN>` is the exact orderable manufacturer part number — the string you
would type at a distributor. Not a family ("ATtiny816"), not an invented
suffix. **"ATtiny816-SSN" was carried for weeks and is not an orderable part;
the 20-pin SOIC is ATTINY816-SN.** A `part.yaml` validated once kills this.

## Structure: `part.yaml`

```yaml
mpn: LM5145RGYR

                            # "10k NTC 3380K" on an R_0402 footprint is a
                            # THERMISTOR; it was coded as a plain 10k resistor
                            # and would have shipped as the temp sensor.
                            # For a CONVERTER the class is machine-graded by
                            # E-TOPO against the topology DERIVED from

                            # (buck_boost where a buck suffices = FAIL).
                            # A part that is NOT a converter (a load switch,
                            # an eFuse, a pass FET, a ferrite) classifies as
                            # NOTHING and may not appear on a `rails:` entry —
                            # such a stage converts nothing and E-TOPO has
                            # nothing to derive.

# LINEAR CONVERTERS ONLY — both REQUIRED before E-TOPO will grade a rail whose
# converter is one. A linear regulator's failure modes are DROPOUT and
# DISSIPATION, and the Vin-vs-Vout topology derivation is blind to BOTH, so a
# LINEAR rail without them is a rail the gate cannot grade — a FAIL, never a
# pass (canon M-COVER). Until 2026-07-27 `normalize_type()` rejected every
# linear part outright, so the only route to a green E-TOPO on an LDO-only
# board was to DELETE power_tree.yaml; three fleet boards took it.

```

`part.yaml` must be complete enough that **the PDF is never opened again for
normal work** — only for re-verification. That is what makes it
context-cheap: 40 lines of YAML instead of 60 pages.

**Record polarity as a part fact wherever the part has one.** `pins: {1: {name: "-", note: "negative blade"}}`
on an XT60 is exactly the fact whose absence shipped a reversed battery
connector — a bug no electrical check can see, because the netlist is
self-consistent either way. **And record it in `asserts:` as well, not only in
prose:** that same XT60's part.yaml already said "PAD 1 IS NEGATIVE - polarity
is a PART FACT" in `gotchas:` and the connector shipped reversed anyway,
because nothing machine-readable ever consulted it (canon P-FACT).

## Forbidden

- A `part.yaml` for a part not on the board (stale after a swap).
- A committed PDF for a rejected candidate.
- Stock/price/availability fields — volatile.
- A family name or invented MPN as the directory name.

## Validate — the parity gate

Same spirit as `kicad-cli pcb drc --schematic-parity`, which caught a missing
part nothing else could:

- every part in the BOM has a `02_parts/<MPN>/` with a `part.yaml`
- every `02_parts/<MPN>/` is in the BOM (catches stale entries after a swap:
  ATtiny816 → ATtiny1616)
- `part.yaml.mpn` == directory name
- every used part's PDF is present (project is standalone)
- `sha256` matches the committed PDF
- `datasheet.revision` appears in the PDF filename
- every `pins:` entry the generator relies on is present
- `type:` present and not merely the value string

## Repair

- BOM part with no `02_parts/` entry → fetch, extract, commit. Do not order
  until it exists.
- `02_parts/` entry not in the BOM → the part was swapped. **DO NOT reflexively
  delete the directory, and note that the parenthetical this bullet USED to
  carry — "git history keeps it" — is the exact wrong reassurance: git keeps the
  BYTES, but every gate reads the WORKING TREE.** `02_parts/` is the MPN
  authority for EVERY sealed release, not just the current board, so removing a
  dossier — or moving its `sourcing.lcsc`/`mpn:` — can break an immutable
  archive that may never be edited (canon **M-DEPEND**).
  It is NOT append-only: a board that legitimately drops a part must be able to
  drop its dossier. What is REQUIRED is that the code every sealed
  `fab/bom.csv` cites still resolves afterwards. Three legitimate outcomes:
  keep the dossier; keep the retired code resolvable as a **mapping-form**
  `alternates:` entry (`- {lcsc: C506653, mpn: MCP23017-E/SS}` — the BARE form
  declares no part number and resolves nothing, see the `sourcing:` note above);
  or move the code->MPN fact to
  `skills/jlcpcb-fab/references/lcsc_passives_ledger.yaml`, the live
  hand-verified home for a code no board vendors any more. Then note the swap in
  `01_docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
  Gated by `sealed_dependency_check.py PROJECT_DIR` and `policy_audit`'s
  M-DEPEND row — which exist because this bullet, as written, CAUSED the
  incident: cooksense's v1.7 work followed it, removed `02_parts/ULN2803ADWR/`,
  and the sealed byte-unchanged `cooksense-v1.6-2026-07-27` flipped F-MPN
  PASS->FAIL on row 56, then flipped BACK when the dossier was restored — twice
  in opposite directions in one session, with nothing recording that it had been
  red. Measured fleet-wide 2026-07-29: **539 rows across 25 of 33 sealed
  releases resolve ONLY because a dossier is still in the tree**, and the 8
  releases carrying their own map contribute zero of them.
- sha256 mismatch → the PDF was replaced with a different revision. STOP: the
  extracted facts may be wrong. Re-verify `pins:` before trusting anything.

## Compliance audit (design-policies.md IDs)

This folder answers: **S3** — every part.yaml pin map read from the
datasheet FIGURE with a `verified:` note citing figure+page (2-pad
passives exempt), and the PDF set includes the PACKAGE/land-pattern
drawing, not just electricals.

- Audit: `policy_audit.py` S-VER flags weak/missing citations
  mechanically; the fresh-context pin review re-derives pinouts for
  actives (the independent half of S3).
- A part that fails S-VER may not enter the BOM until its note cites the

ADR-0005 phase 1).** The class is *every fact imported from outside this repo*;
a pin map is one member, and this folder is where that member is governed. The
grades M-IMPORT defines apply to everything else a `part.yaml` imports too:
**MEASURED** (the physical object, or a machine-readable source — a
`.kicad_pcb`, a drill file, a STEP), **CITED** (a vendor document, WITH figure /
page / section — what a `verified:` note is), **ESTIMATED** (derived,
photogrammetric, inferred — and it MUST carry an error bar). A dimension used in
COPPER is MEASURED or CITED, never ESTIMATED without its bar; a published number
whose DATUM is unstated is ESTIMATED, not CITED; and where the grades disagree
**the object beats its drawing**. The wider rule gained its machine half on
2026-07-27 (ADR-0005 phases 2-4; path superseded by ADR-0009): `03_src/rules/mates.yaml` + `external_hardware/<device>/`,
graded by `import_provenance_check.py` for M-EXIST/M-GRADE/M-BAR/M-PROXY/
M-OWED/M-RESTATE/D-MATE. **It reaches MATING geometry, not this folder**: a
`part.yaml` imports its facts from a datasheet and is still graded by S-VER
plus review, so outside pin maps and outside a `mates.yaml` this remains [H],
and this contract says so rather than implying a check that does not exist.

This folder also answers **P-LAYOUT / P-ADJ** — the datasheet LAYOUT section is
read (not just the pin table) and encoded as a `layout:` block for every IC and
power/sense part (with the routed precedents behind that read catalogued in
`layout_refs:` — datasheet figure, EVM/app-note, OSHWLab-by-LCSC, KiCad
projects — harvested into `proven-parts.yaml` so the search is paid once), and
the board's placement HONOURS it:

- Audit: `policy_audit.py` **P-LAYOUT** fails an in-scope part (multi-pin active,
  or `type:` matching fet/mosfet/current_sense/shunt/crystal/oscillator/inductor)
  that has no `layout:` block with a `source:` citation + a keep_short/adjacency
  budget. **P-ADJ** measures each `layout.keep_short` budget from THE ANCHOR PIN
  (a pad of the declaring part on that net) to its NEAREST QUALIFYING PARTNER
  (the nearest pad on the same net on another footprint), worst anchor wins, and
  names the pair — the datasheet's "keep it local" rule made mechanical, at the
  granularity the sentence has. It is NOT the whole net's worst pad pair: that
  metric made a budget score WORSE when a correctly-placed bulk capacitor was
  added, so it could not guide placement (changed 2026-07-29; the usb-hub-3s-v2
  RSNS incident still FAILS, 7.34mm U1.19 -> Q6.5 against 5mm).
  **P-ADJ-PAIR** grades `layout.adjacency` refdes pairs on the copper GAP
  between them. **P-ADJ-UNREACHED** covers both kinds.
  **E-NETREF** (`net_reference_audit.py`, canon E-NETREF) is the netlist-only
  sibling of P-ADJ-UNREACHED for the `keep_short[].net` field: same defect
  class, different oracle and different reach — no board and no pcbnew, so it
  grades a project before routing; it distinguishes "this net does not exist"
  from P-ADJ's other unreached causes; and it names the NEAR-MISS. It is one of
  eleven reference kinds it grades, because a net name in ANY hand-authored
  source is a reference something will look up (canon M-WIDTH).
  Both are SEPARATE rows and NEITHER is waivable by a P-ADJ waiver:
  P-ADJ-UNREACHED fails any budget that does not resolve to a measurable pair
  here (no such net, fewer than 2 pads, no pad of the declaring part, no shared
  un-poured net, a refdes not on the board). The split is deliberate — a P-ADJ
  waiver's evidence is a set of MEASURED spans, and letting it also cover
  budgets that were never measured, or a different budget KIND, is exactly the
  waiver-widening canon M4 forbids. Any of the three reporting `PASS` over ZERO
  measured budgets is itself a FAIL (canon M-COVER).
- The Layout read is the independent human half: escape/pinout can be right while
  the part is still placed wrong (usb-hub-3s-v2 TPS25740A). P-ADJ is the machine
  half — it caught RSNS span 11.5mm > 5mm on that exact board.

And it answers **P-FACT** — the part's own facts are graded against the board
and the release, not merely written down:

- Audit: `jlcpcb-fab/scripts/part_facts_check.py PROJECT_OR_RELEASE [--strict]`
  (offline; no pcbnew, no network). It grades `pad1_net_polarity` and
  `configured_pin_net` against the exported NETLIST, `value` against the fab
  BOM, `not_on_assembly_bom` against BOM+CPL, and `msl` against the release's
  ORDER paperwork. Use `configured_pin_net` for selected-part truth tables;
  a `configuration:` prose mapping alone proves no realized strap.
- `keepout_region` is DECLARED but NOT YET GRADED (it needs board geometry).
  The checker names it DEFERRED and FAILs it under `--strict`; it never
  reports clean. That is the LTV-817S isolation-barrier class and it is the
  open half of P-FACT.
- An assertion that reaches NO board ref is reported UNREACHED, never passed.
  A gate that grades zero things and prints OK is the `jlc_twin` exit-0 class.
- Adoption is opt-in per part and the coverage line prints
  `N/M part.yaml declare an asserts: block`, so "we check part facts" can
  never be true-sounding and empty.

## Every schema key here NAMES THE GATE THAT READS IT — canon G-ORPHAN

**`schema_reader_audit.py --root REPO`** (`--families` prints the denominator).
**THIS IS THE FILE THE RULE WAS WRITTEN FOR.** `layout.adjacency:` — a
refdes-pair proximity budget — sat in these dossiers looking live while P-ADJ
read `keep_short` entries ONLY, so pluto-rx2-8way's requirement that `U_ESD` sit
within ~2.0 mm of `J_USB`, where 6 nH per 10 mm of loop turns a 17 V clamp into
a 305 V spike, was graded by NO GATE AT ALL and a human had to hand-measure it.
`part.yaml` is the most expensive artifact this pipeline makes and the easiest
place to write a fact that nothing consumes: P-FACT's own row records that until
2026-07-25 only five of its blocks reached any gate.

So every key is classified, and the classification is PROVED out of the named
reader's AST on every run. A key in a real dossier with no row below is an
ORPHAN and FAILS. `ADVISORY` and `OWED` are DECLARED states and both REQUIRE a
reason (canon M4): ADVISORY means nobody reads it AND THAT IS CORRECT — a
datasheet fact spent by a human at part-selection time, whose executable channel
is the `asserts:` block beside it; OWED means a gate is INTENDED and absent.
A trailing `.*` declares a whole subtree, which is how the open per-part fact
bags (`limits:`, `land_pattern:`, `ratings:`) are covered without pretending
their contents are a closed schema — but a subtree declaration is a CLAIM about
the whole bag, and enumerating a key out of one is always the stronger move.

`pins.<N>.tie` IS THE MEASURED HOLE HERE AND IT IS OWED WITH ITS PATCH.
84 pins across 43 dossiers declare which net they must land on, and NOTHING
reads it — not `pin_audit.py`, not `electrical_invariants.py`, not
`net_reference_audit.py`. That is the exact field class the `GND_ISO` ghost that
reached shipped F.Silkscreen lived in: a net NAME in hand-authored source with
no consumer. It belongs to E-NETREF, not to a second net resolver; the K13 patch
is written out in `schema_reader_audit.py`'s docstring, including the
`tie: none` exclusion (`XU316-1024-TQ128-I24` floats four IO-voltage straps
deliberately, and failing those is how a new kind gets waived).

`mechanical:` IS THE SECOND MEASURED HOLE, IT ARRIVED 2026-07-30, AND THE
OBVIOUS READER FOR IT IS A TRAP. The block is a part's 3D ENVELOPE, and the one
dossier that declares it — pluto-rx2-8way-v2's RP2040-Zero — took every number
off the vendor Creo STEP, which is the MEASURED grade (canon M-IMPORT: a
machine-readable source). It is not decoration: `bottom_side_max_protrusion_mm:
1.000` is *why* that board's `assembly.yaml` refuses to have `U_MCU` machine
placed, because 23 components on the carrier-facing face put the joint plane and
the collision plane in the same plane and the module cannot sit down. So the
physics is stated TWICE, in two files, and no gate can make the two disagree.

Which gate is owed it is a real question with a wrong-looking answer, and the
wrong answer is the one this gate exists to refuse. **`assembly_coverage.py`
contains the exact string `"mechanical"` in a READ POSITION — a set literal at
line 84 — so naming it here would score PROVEN and grade NOTHING**, because that
occurrence is the closed `reason:` vocabulary of `03_src/rules/assembly.yaml`, a
different file and a different structure. That is limitation (a) in
`schema_reader_audit.py`'s own docstring ("cannot prove the read is off THIS
structure") arriving as a live temptation rather than a caveat, and it is worth
more than the row: the fix that makes the finding go quiet is available, costs
one word, and is false. Measured 2026-07-30 across nine candidate consumers —
`import_provenance_check.py`, `policy_audit.py`, `escape_check.py`,
`part_facts_check.py`, `pin_audit.py`, `generate_board_generic.py`,
`export_jlc_package.py`, `placement_gates.py` and `assembly_coverage.py` — the
key reaches a read position in exactly one of them, and that one is the
collision. Pinned by `tests/t1_schema_reader.py`
`t_real_finding_module_envelope_has_no_reader_and_the_obvious_one_is_a_collision`.

The honest home is M-IMPORT's machine half. `import_provenance_check.py` already
grades exactly this class — a foreign device's geometry, with a provenance grade
per fact — and is scoped to `03_src/rules/mates.yaml` against `external_hardware/<device>/`,
which this contract's own M-IMPORT section says in as many words does not reach
this folder. A purchased module IS foreign hardware the board mates to, so the
debt has two admissible settlements and both are cheap to state: either the
envelope moves to `external_hardware/<device>/` with a `mates.yaml` reference (canon
M-RESTATE — one home per fact, boards reference and never restate), or
`import_provenance_check.py` grows a `02_parts` reach. Until one of them lands,
these five rows are OWED, and the two self-consistency sums named in the table
(`total_thickness_mm` against its three terms, `bottom_side_max_protrusion_mm`
against the `side: bottom` features) are the cheapest first bite.

### keys: 02_parts/*/part.yaml

| key | reader | why |

| `status` | `jlc_stock_check.py, release_freshness_check.py, shopping_list.py` | lifecycle |
| `superseded_by` | OWED | the retirement pointer of a replaced dossier; `status:` is read, this is not, so a superseded part names its replacement to nobody |
| `function` | ADVISORY | a one-line human summary of what the part is for; the graded facts are `type`, `value` and the `asserts:` block |
| `pin_authority` | ADVISORY | human-readable supplemental catalog/library provenance used to resolve an exact connector drawing ambiguity; executable pin identity remains in `pins:` and is independently graded against the realised schematic/netlist/PCB |
| `pin_authority.*` | ADVISORY | source names, hashes, translations, and interpretation notes for the supplemental authority; these support human review but do not replace the machine-graded `pins:` map |
| `design` | ADVISORY | the free-prose design narrative (a `\|` block on five converter dossiers); its numbers belong in `electrical:`/`limits:` where they can be asserted |
| `notes` | `policy_audit.py` | P8: the part's placement/design notes, whose PRESENCE P-LAYOUT grades |
| `gotchas` | ADVISORY | warnings addressed to the next author to touch this part (128 dossiers). Machine-grading English here would be theatre; what IS graded is that the expensive facts it warns about live in `pins:`/`escape:`/`limits:` |
| `note_dirname` | ADVISORY | records why the directory name differs from the MPN; the MPN authority reads `mpn:` |
| `configuration` | ADVISORY | human-readable register/value summary for programmable parts. Load-bearing configuration values must also live in a dedicated machine-read rule such as `power_stages.yaml` or an executable firmware/readback gate; this free-form dossier block is not itself release authority |
| `configuration.*` | ADVISORY | free-form children of the same human summary; every release-driving value needs a separately machine-read home |
| `on_live_board` | OWED | a claim that this exact part is on a shipped board — checkable against the sealed BOM and checked by nothing |
| `layout_refs` | `policy_audit.py` | the LAYOUT PRECEDENT SEARCH record. **Was OWED until 2026-07-30**, and the debt was real: P8 grades `layout.source:`, while this parallel list — the record of WHAT ELSE EXISTED and how strong it was — was read by nobody. P-PREC now reads it, counting the bare-string form OWED and grading the mapping form |
| `layout_refs[].tier` | `policy_audit.py` | P-PREC: the SKILL.md authority tier this artifact sits at, 1-4. The tier IS the grade — without it an entry names what was read and still cannot be ranked |
| `layout_refs[].artifact` | `policy_audit.py` | P-PREC: the thing itself (URL / document + figure + page / design-file name). An unnamed precedent is not a precedent, and `tier: 2, reached: true` with nothing named is an unfalsifiable claim to have done the most valuable half of the search |
| `layout_refs[].reached` | `policy_audit.py` | P-PREC: CONSULTED (`true`) vs merely KNOWN-OF (`false`). This is the whole distinction the gate exists to make — the pluto-rx2-8way RP2040 dossier drew it correctly in PROSE and no machine could see it |
| `layout_refs[].why` | `policy_audit.py` | P-PREC: REQUIRED (>=20 chars) on a `reached: false` entry. An unreached tier is a DEBT, and a debt without a reason is the waiver-without-evidence shape (canon M-WAIV) |
| `layout_refs[].url` | ADVISORY | retrieval link for the named precedent; `artifact` is the machine-graded identity and this URL is human provenance |
| `layout_refs[].fetched` | ADVISORY | date a precedent was retrieved; useful staleness context, not a physical design fact |
| `layout_refs[].note` | ADVISORY | human transfer/measurement notes for the precedent; executable constraints belong in `layout` |
| `datasheet.url` | ADVISORY | retrieval provenance for a human; P-AUTH selects review bytes only by the declared digest of a local PDF, never by a mutable URL |
| `datasheet.local` | OWED | the in-tree PDF path. M-DEPEND grades that a sealed release carries its dossiers; nothing grades that this path RESOLVES, so a moved PDF is silent |
| `datasheet.sha256` | `pin_audit.py` | P-AUTH: a valid digest whose bytes match one local PDF. A URL, a sole unbound PDF, or an adjacent-family document is not fresh pin-review authority. |
| `datasheet.revision` | OWED | the revision the pin map and limits were read from; a datasheet revving under a sealed release is exactly M-DEPEND's class and this field is where it would be caught |
| `datasheet.doc_id` | ADVISORY | the vendor document number, for a human re-fetching it |
| `datasheet.fetched` | ADVISORY | the date the PDF was pulled, for a human judging staleness |
| `datasheet.pages` | ADVISORY | page count, so a truncated download is visible to a reader |
| `datasheet.note` | ADVISORY | prose about the fetch |
| `datasheet.provenance` | ADVISORY | prose about where the PDF came from |
| `datasheet.product_page` | ADVISORY | the vendor landing page |
| `datasheet.lcsc_url` | ADVISORY | the distributor page the PDF was reached through |
| `datasheet.interface_standard` | ADVISORY | the governing interface specification used alongside the component datasheet (for example USB-IF USB 2.0); the human pin/electrical review consumes it, while no machine gate interprets arbitrary standards PDFs |
| `datasheet.interface_standard.*` | ADVISORY | human provenance bag for that standard (`title`, `url`, vendored `local`, `sha256`, and cited `section`); the executable consequences belong in pin identities/electrical assertions, while no gate can derive them from an arbitrary standards PDF |
| `datasheet.package_url` | ADVISORY | a human retrieval link for the vendor package page; the executable package identity is `package`/`footprint`, and no gate reads this URL |
| `datasheet.drawing` | ADVISORY | a human citation to the package drawing; `pin_audit.py` grades the figure/page citation in `verified`, not this parallel prose field |
| `datasheet.drawing.url` | ADVISORY | the human retrieval URL for the cited package drawing; no gate fetches it |
| `datasheet.drawing_url` | ADVISORY | legacy flat spelling of the human retrieval URL for a package drawing; no gate fetches it |
| `datasheet.drawing.revision` | ADVISORY | the human-readable package-drawing revision; no gate compares it with the vendored footprint |
| `datasheet.drawing.sha256` | OWED | the package-drawing digest is a checkable provenance claim, but no reader recomputes it, so substituted drawing content is silent |
| `datasheet.pdf` | ADVISORY | an alternate spelling of `local:` on two dossiers; consolidate on `local:` |
| `datasheet.file` | ADVISORY | as `pdf:` |
| `pins.<N>` | `pin_audit.py, circuit_json_to_kicad_sch.py, policy_audit.py` | the pin map, in the bare `<N>: "name"` scalar form |
| `pins.<N>.name` | `pin_audit.py, circuit_json_to_kicad_sch.py, policy_audit.py` | the pin map, mapping form |
| `pins.<N>.type` | ADVISORY | human-readable electrical pin category on the CH224K dossier; executable connection and stress constraints live in the netlist invariants and protection-path contract |
| `pins.<N>.note` | ADVISORY | per-pin datasheet prose (274 pins). The CONSTRAINTS inside it belong in `electrical.pins.<N>`, which IS graded by `node_level` |
| `pins.<N>.tie` | OWED | 84 pins name the net they must land on and NOTHING reads it — the `GND_ISO` field class. E-NETREF K13; the patch is in `schema_reader_audit.py`'s docstring |
| `pin_aliases` | `pin_map_check.py` | optional, explicit logical-to-artifact pin identity map; identity is the default and aliases are never inferred from equal nets |
| `pin_aliases.<N>.schematic` | `pin_map_check.py` | schematic pin identity reached by logical pin `<N>` |
| `pin_aliases.<N>.footprint` | `pin_map_check.py` | physical footprint pad identity reached by logical pin `<N>` |
| `pin_aliases.<N>.fused` | `pin_map_check.py` | declares that an intentional many-logical-pins-to-one-pad collapse is a manufacturer-fused land |
| `pin_aliases.<N>.why` | `pin_map_check.py` | required explanation for every non-identity mapping |
| `pin_aliases.<N>.evidence` | `pin_map_check.py` | required datasheet/package-drawing citation for every non-identity mapping |
| `escape.style` | `escape_check.py` | P-ESC escape geometry class; qfn/dfn share the bottom-terminated ring model, with pitch, budget, conditions and tier still independently checked |
| `escape.pitch` | `escape_check.py` | P-ESC pitch |
| `escape.tier_required` | `escape_check.py, policy_audit.py` | P-TIER: the fab tier the escape needs |
| `escape.escapes_worst_side` | `escape_check.py` | P-ESC worst-side count |
| `escape.pins` | ADVISORY | descriptive total pin count for an asymmetric package; the exact footprint/pin map and worst-side escape count own the executable geometry |
| `escape.conditions` | `escape_check.py` | P-ESC qualifying conditions |
| `escape.tier_conditional` | OWED | a declared conditional fab tier that no reader compares with `escape_check.py`'s independently computed `tier_conditional()` result; a stale declaration is currently silent |
| `escape.checked` | OWED | the date/method the escape was calibrated. 125 dossiers carry it; `escape_check.py` recomputes the geometry and never reads this, so a stale calibration note is invisible |
| `escape.loaded_side_escapes` | OWED | a second escape count for the loaded side, declared once and read by nothing |
| `escape.per_pin.<N>` | OWED | per-pin escape overrides; not declared by any dossier today, and P-ESC would not see one if it were |
| `mates` | `escape_check.py` | the mating connector class |
| `layout.source` | `policy_audit.py` | P8: the datasheet Layout section cited |
| `layout.reviewed` | OWED | the date the layout section was read. P-LAYOUT grades that `layout:` EXISTS and that `source:` is cited; nothing grades this, so an unreviewed copy of a sibling's block reads identically |
| `layout.route_topology.kind` | `placement_routability_preflight.py` | part-class route semantics: `shunt`, `series_flow_through`, or `series_directional`; each placed critical-path instance must agree with this dossier authority before placement promotion |
| `layout.route_topology.*` | `placement_routability_preflight.py` | exact reusable signal/return or common/selected/unused pad banks; each route instance must match these dossier-owned sets and its declared critical-pair nets |
| `layout.notes` | `policy_audit.py` | P-LAYOUT: prose rules, whose presence satisfies the declare-something obligation |
| `layout.footprint_adjudication` | ADVISORY | human record of why manufacturer land geometry supersedes a distributor CAD footprint; realized footprint/model checks own executable acceptance |
| `layout.keep_short[].net` | `policy_audit.py, net_reference_audit.py` | P-ADJ span budget subject (E-NETREF K7) |
| `layout.keep_short[].max_span_mm` | `policy_audit.py` | P-ADJ budget; a non-numeric value is a FAIL, not a skip |
| `layout.keep_short[].anchor_pins` | `policy_audit.py` | P-ADJ anchor override — an unstated anchor is a hidden assumption |
| `layout.keep_short[].partner_refs` | `policy_audit.py` | P-ADJ restricts the nearest-partner search to the explicitly named reference designators |
| `layout.keep_short[].why` | `policy_audit.py` | the datasheet requirement being honoured |

| `electrical.source` | ADVISORY | the datasheet section the electrical block was read from, for a reviewer |
| `electrical.*` | OWED | the rest of the block is per-part datasheet numbers with no consumer: coil pull-in/resistance over temperature, Vce(sat)/Vds points, r_on corners, dropout, tempco, `t_op`. Each is the kind of number a `part_value`/`node_level` invariant SHOULD cite, and the cooksense relay coil at 70 C is the worked case for why (it was checked by hand) |
| `limits.*` | ADVISORY | the open per-part absolute-maximum/rating fact bag. The EXECUTABLE channel for anything in here is an `asserts:` entry or an `electrical_invariants.yaml` `part_value`/`node_level` that cites it; the bag itself is a human's datasheet transcription and forcing a schema on it would only push the facts out of the tree |
| `land_pattern.*` | ADVISORY | the human derivation record for a vendored footprint — pad sizes, fillet balance, datums, the datasheet figure they came from. Its CONSEQUENCE is graded, hard, by `jlc_twin` against JLC's own CAD model (canon M1), which is a stronger check than reading this back would be |
| `recommended_land.*` | ADVISORY | manufacturer recommended-land provenance used by a human footprint review; accepted geometry must be re-measured on the realised footprint/board |
| `twin_body.*` | `jlc_twin.py` | installed-product body authority for a deliberately non-CPL part: `source`, project model path or retained board model, exact `identity`, and the evidence/limitation surfaced in each `LOCAL-BODY` report row |
| `ratings.*` | OWED | per-part electrical ratings (`i_sat`, `dcr_max`, `impedance_100mhz`, `voltage`, `dielectric`, ...). Unlike `limits:` these are the SELECTION criteria the part was chosen on, so they are assertable — an inductor's `i_sat` against the rail's `iout_max_A` is arithmetic nothing does |
| `power_pins.<NAME>.*` | OWED | a per-rail pin grouping on the one 128-pin MCU dossier. `pins:` is graded; this parallel structure is a second home for the same map and read by nobody |
| `mechanical.pcb_thickness_mm` | OWED | the part's own laminate thickness — one term of the carrier stack and of `total_thickness_mm`'s sum, read by nothing |
| `mechanical.top_side_max_height_mm` | OWED | tallest feature on the face AWAY from the carrier: the enclosure/lid budget. Spent by a human today, and nothing reconciles it against the per-feature heights in the bag below |
| `mechanical.bottom_side_max_protrusion_mm` | OWED | **THE SEATABILITY NUMBER, and the load-bearing key of this block.** Tallest feature on the CARRIER-FACING face, so non-zero means the part cannot be reflowed flat — a POPULATION decision, not a footprint note. RP2040-Zero declares 1.000 (the 12 MHz crystal, MEASURED off the vendor STEP) and pluto-rx2-8way-v2's `assembly.yaml` carries the matching `not_assembled` entry for `U_MCU`, whose evidence opens "MECHANICAL, and MEASURED rather than argued". `assembly_coverage.py` grades that entry's SHAPE — reason inside the closed vocabulary, dated evidence, the ref off the CPL — and never that the reason is TRUE. The intended gate is the one that makes the two homes able to DISAGREE OUT LOUD |
| `mechanical.total_thickness_mm` | OWED | the stack, and it is DERIVED: bottom protrusion + laminate + top height (1.000 + 1.091 + 3.250 = 5.341 on the one dossier that declares it). A sum nothing re-adds is the `ratings.*` shape — assertable arithmetic with no assertion |
| `mechanical.*` | OWED | the per-FEATURE 3D bag: one entry per named feature the vendor model contains (`usb_c`, `buttons`, `ws2812`, `rp2040`, `crystal`, `rt9013`, `flash` on the RP2040-Zero), each carrying its `side`, its footprint (`extent_mm`/`centre_mm`/`body_mm`) and how proud it stands (`protrusion_mm`/`height_mm`), plus per-kind connector terms (`mating_face_y_mm`, `z_mm`, `shell_x_mm`, `cavity_centreline_above_pcb_top_mm`). BLANKET because the feature NAMES and their per-kind terms are both open; the four scalars above are enumerated OUT of it because they are not. Two facts in here are ARITHMETIC against those scalars and nothing performs it: `bottom_side_max_protrusion_mm` must be the max `protrusion_mm` over the `side: bottom` entries (max(0.850, 1.000, 0.700) = 1.000 today), and a `mating_face_y_mm` past the part outline is a carrier KEEPOUT the floorplan must honour (24.816 against an outline ending at 23.500 — 1.21 mm of receptacle hanging over the board edge) |
| `mechanical_pads.<NAME>.*` | OWED | shield/NPTH pads and their KiCad pad names — the field that decides whether a shell tab is a net or a hole, read by nothing |
| `orientation.*` | OWED | the as-placed rotation and pin-1/pole marker evidence. The rotation AUTHORITY is `jlc_rotation_*`; this per-dossier claim is not cross-checked against it, which is the M-PROV shape |
| `loading_caps.*` | OWED | a crystal's load-capacitor formula and per-leg value — an `electrical_invariants.yaml` `part_value` waiting to be written |
| `i2c.address` | OWED | the device address; a bus with two parts at one address is checkable from the dossiers alone |
| `dropout_mv` | `power_topology.py` | E-TOPO linear dropout bound |
| `pdiss_max_mw` | `power_topology.py` | E-TOPO linear dissipation bound |
| `sourcing.lcsc` | `bom_source_check.py, part_facts_check.py, shopping_list.py` | the LCSC code on the BOM |
| `sourcing.alternates[].lcsc` | `bom_legibility_check.py` | F-ECHO substitution candidates |
| `sourcing.alternates[].mpn` | `bom_legibility_check.py` | F-ECHO substitution candidates |
| `sourcing.digikey` | `shopping_list.py` | Q-family distributor lookup |
| `sourcing.note` | `shopping_list.py` | sourcing prose surfaced in the shopping list |
| `sourcing.rejected_catalog_near_matches` | ADVISORY | human review record for catalog hits that resemble but do not equal the selected MPN; no gate consumes this prose, and that is intentional because executable exclusions belong in exact BOM identity, `assembly.yaml`, and footprint/twin adjudication |
| `sourcing.jlc_basic` | OWED | basic-vs-extended, which sets the assembly fee and the stock risk; `jlc_stock_check.py` queries the catalog and never reads this claim, so the two cannot be reconciled |
| `sourcing.do_not_use` | OWED | an explicit ban on a code. Nothing reads it, so a banned code can be typed back into a BOM with every gate green |
| `sourcing.mfr_substituted` | OWED | records that the manufacturer was substituted; `release_freshness_check.py --sourcing-supersede` grades the BOM/CPL delta of a substitution and does not read this |
