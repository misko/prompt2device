# ACTUALLY OPENED: a same-basename file under this root that nothing read
# (GG-SHADOW — on an ADR-0007 two-board project every flat `03_src/rules/<name>`
# gate grades ONE board and reports on the PROJECT), and a path a gate SELECTED
# that is not there while that basename is (GG-RESOLVE).

# ADVISORY ON PURPOSE — `|| true`, and that is a decision, not an oversight. A
# day-one fleet mandate lands as red rows on every board and is switched off
# within the week; this repo has already lost a check that way. What this line
# buys a board agent is the NAMES, at the moment they are cheap to act on.
#
# IT DOES NOT WRITE INTO THIS PROJECT. The battery runs against a
# `cp -a --reflink=auto` copy with symlinks preserved: traced gates open
# `*.kicad_prl` (every pcbnew LoadBoard does) and `06_build/policy_audit.md` for
# writing, and a grader that mutates its subject is not observing it.
# `--in-place` opts out. MEASURED 11 s on a two-board project.

# READ THE READ COUNT WITH ITS CAVEAT. It is a SUPERSET of subject evidence: a
# battery gate's own output that ALREADY EXISTED when the run started is counted

# (an EXISTENCE test) is an IDENTITY test. Only the ZERO carries a verdict.
