Plain python3. No pcbnew. The only network call is Mouser's Search API.

WHY THIS EXISTS — three incidents, one escalating lesson (canon M-QUOTE, the
narrow instance of M-IMPORT scoped to DISTRIBUTOR facts).

  1. GHR-10V-S. Reported to the user as available on the strength of a DigiKey
     SEARCH-RESULT SNIPPET reading "available to order today with same-day
     shipping". The product page said **In Stock: 0**. That sentence is
     boilerplate; it renders at zero stock. A SNIPPET IS NOT A STOCK FIGURE.

  2. 10FDZ-BT(S)(LF)(SN). The Mouser API, asked `partSearchOptions: "Exact"`
     for the fully-suffixed manufacturer MPN our own `02_parts/` dossier holds,
     returns ONE hit: `LifecycleStatus: Obsolete`, `MouserPartNumber: "N/A"`,
     `Availability: null`, zero price breaks. The same part, searched
     `partSearchOptions: "None"` on the suffix-stripped `10FDZ-BT`, returns TWO
     records, one of them **37 In Stock** at $0.96/1 under Mouser part number
     `306-10FDZBTSLFSN` — whose own digits encode S / LF / SN, so the live
     record IS the (S)(LF)(SN) variant, merely catalogued under the bare MPN.
     ONE PHYSICAL PART, THREE CATALOG RECORDS, THREE DIFFERENT ANSWERS.
     A MACHINE-READABLE FIELD IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY THE RIGHT FIELD, AND ONE
     RECORD IS NOT THE PART. Measured 2026-07-27; the fixture is
     `tests/fixtures/shopping_list/mouser/`.

  3. Same defect class, and the repo already has its name: the ADJACENT-PROPERTY
     ERROR (M-IMPORT's co-resident corollary) — measuring something NEAR the
     property you need. #1 measures the state of a search page; #2 measures the
     state of a CATALOG ENTRY. Neither measures the state of the PART. That #2
     fires through a JSON API is the whole reason "use the API" is not by itself
     the lesson, and why the broad re-search below is STRUCTURAL rather than a
     comment: `grade_mouser()` refuses to emit an unsourceable verdict until
     `RecordSet.broad_done` is True.

THE CHECK IDS (design-policies.md, row M-QUOTE):

  Q-COVER   every selected part is looked up at every declared distributor and
            the report prints `N/M`. A part the tool could not look up is a
            FAIL, never an omission. The user has been burned by exactly this:
            `bom_source_check` dropped 87 of 673 rows and exited 0.
  Q-WIDE    an "obsolete / no stock" verdict from an API is reportable only
            AFTER the broad (suffix-stripped, non-exact) search has also run
            and returned nothing better. A lone exact hit is a prompt to search
            wider, not a finding.
  Q-STOCK   a line counts as SOURCEABLE only at stock > --min-stock (the user's
            standing bar: >10) AND stock >= the quantity needed. A line that
            fails is REPORTED as a finding, never dropped and never silently
            substituted.
  Q-SNIPPET a manual quote must name the PAGE it was read from and the date it
            was read. `source: search_snippet` is refused as a stock figure
            (incident 1) and so is a quote older than --quote-max-age-days.
  Q-GRADE   every number carries its M-IMPORT grade — CITED (machine-readable
            API response, or a product page read with its URL and date),
            ESTIMATED (anything volatile and unverifiable: Amazon, always), or
            OWED (nobody has this fact yet; here is how to obtain it). An
            absent grade is a FAIL, never a quiet promotion.
  Q-2SOURCE when --required-pools is set, each exact manufacturer/MPN row must
            be sourceable from that many independent authorized pools. JLC,
            Mouser and DigiKey qualify; Amazon never does. Per-distributor gaps
            remain visible but no longer falsify a green composed-pool verdict.

THE CREDENTIAL. Never embedded, never printed, never logged, never written into
a cache file or a URL this tool emits. Resolution order:
  1. $MOUSER_API_KEY
  2. <repo root>/.secrets/mouser.env   (repo root = the first ancestor holding
     BOTH `skills/` and `contracts.md`; `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns
     a WORKTREE, which is how this was got wrong the first time)
  3. absent -> say so, degrade to the manual path, and grade every Mouser line
     OWED. Never crash, and never produce an unsourced list that looks sourced.

RATE LIMIT. Mouser publishes 50 parts per call, 30 calls per minute, 1,000 calls
per day (mouser.com/api-search/). This tool sleeps 2.1 s between calls (28.6/min)
and refuses to exceed --call-budget in one run. Mouser's API terms forbid caching
their content, so the cache here is a SESSION cache only: it lives in the
gitignored, disposable `06_build/cache/mouser/`, carries `fetched_at`, defaults
to a 6-hour TTL, is never committed, and is never treated as truth at order time
(project 06_build contract, "Forbidden: treating a cached stock number as truth
at order time").

DigiKey HAS an API and this tool does not use it, because it needs OAuth 2.0
client credentials nobody has provided and an agent cannot create an account or
obtain a key. To promote every DigiKey row from ESTIMATED/OWED to CITED:

  1. Sign in at https://developer.digikey.com/ with a DigiKey account.
  2. Create an Organization, then a PRODUCTION app (Sandbox returns
     structurally-correct but incomplete data — do not source from it).
  3. Subscribe the app to **Product Information V4**.
  4. Copy the app's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
  5. Append them to `<repo>/.secrets/digikey.env` (mode 600; `.secrets/` is
     already gitignored):
         DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID=...
         DIGIKEY_CLIENT_SECRET=...
  6. Tell me, and the 2-legged flow (POST client_id + client_secret +
     grant_type=client_credentials to https://api.digikey.com/v1/oauth2/token,
     then GET /products/v4/search/{mpn}/productdetails) becomes a peer of the
     Mouser path.

Until then DigiKey numbers come only from a PRODUCT PAGE a human opened,
recorded in `01_docs/sourcing/manual_quotes.yaml` with its URL and read date.
NEVER from a search-results snippet — that is the GHR-10V-S defect."""
