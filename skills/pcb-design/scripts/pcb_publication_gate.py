"""Fail-closed gate for publishing material PCB project changes.

This is the boundary between "the generated board is mechanically green" and
"this design state may be published on the repository's main line".  It grades
every materially changed project and requires each live board to be represented
by a complete sealed release whose independent reviews bind the exact board
bytes.  A zero-project denominator is only a pass when the git diff proves that
no material PCB project path changed, except for a complete tracked project
tree relocated byte/mode-identically from ``projects/<name>`` to the previously
absent ``archived_projects/<name>``.

The archive is part of that proof, not an ungraded destination.  Every committed
change below ``archived_projects/`` is refused unless it is wholly explained by
one such same-name relocation.  This keeps a valid archive move from laundering
an addition, deletion, content edit, or mode edit in any frozen archive.

The enclosure stream is deliberately independent.  Changes lexically rooted
at ``03_src/mechanical`` or ``07_enclosure_releases`` are classified as
enclosure-only and do not put the parent PCB into this gate's reseal/RF-build
denominator.  One exact connector-service authority can join that mechanical
classification, but only when base/head bytes prove its companion child
contract gained exactly one approved allowlist row and nothing else.  This gate
does not validate those changes; the enclosure release gate remains their
authority.  Prefix exemptions remain exact-prefix-only and the connector
allowance is a paired diff proof, so every other path under PCB source,
generated KiCad, fabrication releases, or reviews continues to fail closed
into ordinary PCB publication grading.

A boardless system-integration record is also explicit rather than exempt. A
tracked ``01_docs/project-scope.json`` declaration may replace that parent in
the denominator with its named PCB children only when the parent has no board
at either side of the publication diff and every distinct child owns exactly
one tracked live board at the head. The child projects are then graded by this
same release boundary even when their own paths did not change. Introducing a
declaration therefore cannot turn an existing board project, a missing child,
or an unsealed child into a zero-board pass.

The gate is intentionally pcbnew-free.  It composes the existing release gates
and adds the publication-only properties they cannot infer from an isolated
release directory: live-source identity, review archive identity, review
artifact binding, and source-commit freshness.

A superseding release declares its freshness shape as structured MANIFEST
data.  Publication must replay that same stronger mode: invoking ordinary
freshness on a legitimate docs-only successor rejects the byte identity that
``--docs-only-supersede`` is specifically designed to prove.
