"""RELEASE-ARTIFACT FRESHNESS gate.

A release seal must ship the CURRENT board's own outputs, a manifest whose
claimed result matches the audit it bundles, and a FINAL (not draft) order
README. This gate FAILS a seal on three ways that combination has silently
broken in the past — each one a DO-NOT-ORDER defect no other gate caught.

Motivating incident (usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.2, 2026-07-23 — a redesigned board):

  (a) STALE ARTIFACT. pdf/assembly_back.pdf, pdf/assembly_front.pdf and
      pdf/pcb_layers.pdf were BYTE-IDENTICAL (sha256-confirmed) to the PRIOR
      release v1.1's same-named files — the redesigned board shipped the OLD
      board's fab drawings. A changed board's generated fab/PDF outputs MUST
      differ from an earlier release of the same board.

  (b) AUDIT / MANIFEST DISAGREEMENT. The shipped verification/policy_audit.md
      said "M-BOM FAIL" / "Summary: FAIL=1", while the MANIFEST claimed
      "policy_audit: 0 FAIL" and "M-BOM ... PASS". The bundle contradicted its
      own claimed result — the manifest under-reported the audit it ships.

  (c) DRAFT README. The shipped ORDER_README.md was a working draft
      ("> DRAFT for the v1.2 seal", "fold its verdict in before seal") — a
      pre-seal staging document, not the final order document.

Second motivating incident (crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.0, 2026-07-23 —
found 2026-07-24, AFTER sealing):

  (d) MANIFEST SELF-INCONSISTENCY. The manifest's human-readable gate
      summary disagreed with the machine evidence it SHIPS, three ways at
      once, and no gate caught any of them:
        - MANIFEST said "ERC 0 errors (1409 baselined warnings)" while the
          bundled verification/policy_audit.md said "S-ERC PASS 0 errors
          (1215 warnings)" (the bundled erc.json measures 1409 — the audit
          row was the stale one);
        - MANIFEST said "bom_source_check PASS (48 lines...)" while
          fab/bom.csv actually carries 49 data rows;
        - verification/bom_source_check.txt named
          "07_releases/v1.0-2026-07-23/fab/bom.csv" — a directory that is
          NOT this release's sealed name
          (crow-recorder-central-v2-v1.0-2026-07-23): the evidence was
          produced against a staging path and never re-pointed.
      Check (b) compares only the policy_audit RESULT, and the stale check
      compares only bytes across releases — prose counts and embedded paths
      had no gate. Check (d) closes that: any COUNT the MANIFEST states
      that is also present in shipped evidence must MATCH (ERC errors /
      warnings across MANIFEST, policy_audit.md's S-ERC row, and erc.json;
      bom_source_check's claimed line count vs fab/bom.csv's actual data
      rows), and any 07_releases/<dir>/ path embedded in verification
      evidence must name THIS release's directory (or an EXISTING sibling
      release — diffing against a real predecessor is legitimate). A count
      the MANIFEST does not state is not checked: absence != mismatch.

Fifth check — A-STOCK, always on (2026-07-25, the PCBA-default posture):

  (e) STOCK EVIDENCE THAT DOES NOT PASS. Five sealed releases in this fleet
      ship `verification/stock_check.*` whose LAST LINE says FAIL —
      crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.0-v1.3 record their own CPU (C6938291, the
      XU316 SoC) at LOW_STOCK(0) — because nothing ever parsed the verdict.
      Check (e) grades the shipped evidence for every coded BOM line that has
      a CPL row: stock >= qty x `build_quantity`, or a matching
      `03_src/rules/assembly.yaml` `sourcing_plan:` entry with
      `measured_stock` + `measured_on`. A MISSING OR UNPARSEABLE VERDICT IS A
      FAIL, NOT A SKIP: cooksense v1.1 ships a raw `--out` CSV report as
      stock_check.txt with ZERO verdict lines, so a parser that shrugged at an
      unfamiliar shape could be silenced by choosing a shape. The check is
      OFFLINE — it grades EVIDENCE; live re-query stays in the opt-in --net
      tier, because a gate that needs the network is a gate that gets skipped.

A SEAL MAKES TWO CLAIMS AND THIS GATE USED TO HAVE ONE FIELD FOR BOTH
(2026-07-30, checks (f) A-BUY and (g) M-REV):

    | claim                        | who can answer it            |
    |------------------------------|------------------------------|
    | *this design is correct*     | the design gates, at SEAL time |
    | *this design is orderable*   | JLCPCB allocation, at ORDER time |

  Every other check here grades an artifact WE CONTROL, so a red means *there
  exists an edit to this design that turns it green* and blocking the seal is
  right. Historically **A-STOCK graded the WORLD** through catalog
  `stockCount`; that mode remains only for sealed-release compatibility. One
  reading moved from 0 on 2026-07-29 to 5 on 2026-07-30 on the same unchanged
  board, and NO EDIT
  TO THE DESIGN CHANGES IT. Measured cost of merging the two claims into one
  verdict: smc0985-cooksense v1.7 reached DRC 0/0/0, `policy_audit` FAIL=0,
  ERC 0, E-INV 167/167, both red-team lenses graded — and NINE successive
  agents declined to seal it, every one of them on one BOM line whose
  `minPurchaseNum` (21) exceeds its entire `stockCount` (5). Nine refusals,
  zero design defects. The last red-team lens wrote, verbatim: *"I would accept
  the seal ... but sealing is not the question this verdict field asks."*

  So the gate now grades and prints TWO verdicts, and `--claim` grades either
  one alone:

      DESIGN:   PASS | FAIL (n finding(s))
      SOURCING: CLEAR | PLANNED-<n> | BLOCKED-<n> [ + FAIL (n finding(s)) ]

  THIS IS NOT AN ESCAPE HATCH, AND IT IS A NET TIGHTENING. Before it, a
  `sourcing_plan:` entry SILENTLY CLEARED its line whatever its own measured
  number said — `if code in plan: continue` — so a release could seal
  unbuyable with nothing anywhere saying so. Now:

  (f) A-BUY — THE SOURCING CLAIM IS CLASSIFIED, AND A NON-ORDERABLE RELEASE
      MUST SAY SO WHERE THE BUYER LOOKS.

      **THE ID IS `A-BUY` AND NOT `A-ORDER`, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE.**
      This check was drafted as `A-ORDER`, which has meant something ELSE since
      2026-07-17 (`ae93b4b`): `rules_audit.py`'s A-ORDER asserts that
      `generate_rules.py` is the LAST step to touch the project before the DRC
      gate, because a pcbnew save clobbers netclasses. It is load-bearing and
      cited by name in `tests/README.md`, `t4_regressions.py`,
      `t1_rules_bom.py` and `t1_assembly_gates.py`. Two unrelated checks under
      one ID is the M-WIDTH failure inverted — one NAME, two policies — and it
      is worse than a missing ID: a canon row would have had to describe both,
      a waiver written for either would read as covering the other, and a
      fleet-wide `grep A-ORDER` would answer neither question. `A-BUY` reads
      alongside `A-STOCK` (can we buy it / is it in stock) and collides with
      nothing: MEASURED 2026-07-30, zero occurrences anywhere in the repo
      before this change.

      A `sourcing_plan:` entry whose own
      `measured_stock` does not cover `qty x build_quantity` MUST declare
      `order_status: PLANNED|BLOCKED` — PLANNED means the plan makes the
      catalog irrelevant for that line (consignment, self-supply), BLOCKED
      means it cannot be bought as sealed. An unclassified shortfall is a FAIL
      (it used to be a silent pass). A release measured BLOCKED-<n> may seal,
      and ONLY if BOTH `MANIFEST.txt` and the FIRST SCREEN of `ORDER_README.md`
      carry the gate line

          SOURCING: BLOCKED-<n> (C265111; measured 2026-07-30)

      whose status, count, LCSC set and date all MATCH the measurement, in both
      directions — a release may neither hide a blocked line nor invent one.
      The date must be the newest `measured_on` of the blocking entries and may
      not predate the release by more than 7 days: a stock reading is
      perishable, and an undated one is not evidence.

  (g) M-REV — THE REVIEW VERDICTS, WHICH NOTHING HAS EVER PARSED. The
      07_releases contract has required "both lenses' verdicts = ORDER" since
      it was written and no gate read the field. MEASURED 2026-07-30, quoted
      against its population denominator (canon M-COVER): of 33 sealed
      release dirs, 21 ship both contract-named lens files, and 9 OF THOSE 21
      carry an ungradeable verdict on at least one lens — 5 with no verdict
      KEY at all, 8 with a value outside every stated vocabulary, overlap 4.
      Only 12 of 21 are parseable. The commonest shape is `verdict: DO NOT
      ORDER` written as prose after the colon (first token `DO`); cooksense
      v1.5's shipped `redteam_layout.md` does not use the key at all — line 5
      reads `VERDICT AT RUN TIME: **DO NOT ORDER.**` — a sealed release
      carrying a DO-NOT-ORDER review nobody read. The review
      header is therefore graded as a CLOSED VOCABULARY, never scraped from
      prose (that is the R-LEN word-credit defect):

          design_verdict: SOUND | DEFECTIVE          -> the DESIGN claim
          order_verdict:  ORDER | DO-NOT-ORDER | BLOCKED-SOURCING

      A legacy single `verdict:` maps CONSERVATIVELY — `DO-NOT-ORDER`/`FAIL`
      become DEFECTIVE, so no existing review is retroactively converted into
      an acceptance; the split gives the NEXT reviewer the vocabulary, it does
      not rewrite the last one's judgement. A missing or out-of-vocabulary
      verdict is a FAIL, never a skip (the A-STOCK clause, applied to reviews).
      `order_verdict` is cross-checked against (f)'s MEASUREMENT: a lens may
      not say ORDER on a release measured BLOCKED, nor BLOCKED-SOURCING on one
      measured CLEAR.

  ORDER-TIME RE-GRADE. New pipelines use `--claim sourcing
  --sourcing-authority jlc-pcba --pcba-evidence RECEIPT.json`. Only a fresh,
  exact-BOM, quantity-expanded `ALLOCATED` receipt may clear the order claim.
  `--stock-evidence` and the default `catalog-legacy` authority remain solely
  so historical sealed releases retain their original interpretation.

Usage:
    release_freshness_check.py <release_dir> [--releases-root DIR]
                               [--assembly 03_src/rules/assembly.yaml]
                               [--allow-identical RELPATH ]...

                               --designators R4,R5

VALUE-CHANGE SUPERSEDE MODE (--value-change-supersede <prior> --designators):
a PART VALUE moved on parts that are already placed (22k -> 33k on an existing
0603), so the ASSEMBLY DATA moves and the COPPER does not. Measured on
crow-mic-pod-v2 v1.3, 2026-07-28: `export_jlc_package.py` reads
`val = fp.GetValue()` FROM THE BOARD and feeds that one string to BOTH the BOM
`Comment` column and the CPL `Val` column, so a pure value change moves the
`.kicad_pcb`, the `.kicad_sch`, the `.net`, the BOM rows for those refs and
exactly their CPL `Val` cells — while all 11 gerbers and drills stay
BYTE-IDENTICAL. Every earlier mode refuses it, correctly and for its own
reason: docs-only needs fab/ identical, bom-only permits only row REMOVAL of
UNPLACED refs, legible-bom reads a changed LCSC as a substitution, sourcing
demands an md5-identical board and a byte-identical CPL, and cpl-only names a
`Val` change as its own explicit exclusion. Without this mode the only way to
seal a copper-identical value fix is to hand-edit a CSV, which canon M3
forbids. See `check_value_change_delta`.

SOURCING SUPERSEDE MODE (--sourcing-supersede <prior-release-dir>):
the board is untouched and JLC will not SUPPLY one line of the prior BOM, so a
part is SUBSTITUTED — `MPN` + `LCSC` move on the affected rows and nothing else
does. Promoted under canon M8 (two-strike): usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.11 sealed this
exact shape gated by SEVEN individually-measured file waivers because no mode
permitted a changed LCSC, and crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.7 needs the identical
thing. A waiver a human writes is weaker evidence than an assertion the gate
makes; this mode makes the assertion. See `check_sourcing_delta`.

LEGIBLE-BOM SUPERSEDE MODE (--legible-bom-supersede <prior-release-dir>):
canon F-LEGIBLE (ADR-0006) — the board is untouched and `fab/bom.csv` is
rewritten so JLC's web processing can PARSE it (MPN filled from the part's own
dossier, a Comment no longer an LCSC code or a `simple_*` placeholder, a UTF-8
byte-order-mark). Docs-only mode refuses (fab/ changed) and bom-only mode
refuses too (it FAILs on an EDITED row, correctly, for the A-POP defect IT
guards). This mode exempts exactly `fab/bom.csv` and then asserts something
STRONGER than identity about it: every row's designator group, Footprint and
LCSC UNCHANGED, no row added or removed, no MPN blanked, only Comment/MPN
moving — and the new BOM must PASS `bom_legibility_check` while the prior one
FAILs it. See `check_legible_bom_delta`.

DOCS-ONLY SUPERSEDE MODE (--docs-only-supersede <prior-release-dir>):
a documentation-only supersede release (usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.4, 2026-07-23)
INTENTIONALLY ships its fab outputs byte-identical to its predecessor — the
board did not change, only the documentation did. The default stale check
would flag exactly that identity as a defect. In this mode the declared
identity is ASSERTED instead of flagged:

  - fab/, source/, 3d/ MUST be byte-identical to the prior release (any
    differing, missing, or added file is a FAIL — a "docs-only" release
    that changes fab is lying about being docs-only);
  - pdf/ identical to the prior release is ALLOWED (not flagged);
  - the order README and MANIFEST MUST DIFFER from the prior release's (a
    supersede that changes no document supersedes nothing);
  - checks (b) audit==manifest and (c) no draft markers still run.

`<release_dir>` is one sealed release directory,
`07_releases/<version>-<date>/`. Earlier releases of the SAME board are its
siblings under `07_releases/` with a strictly-lower version; they are read
READ-ONLY for the stale comparison. Exit 0 = fresh, non-zero = a defect that
must block the seal.

Documented exception mechanism (for a legitimately-unchanged file across a
doc-only re-release — the edge case): list the relative path, WITH a reason,
one per line in `<release_dir>/verification/freshness_exceptions.txt`
(`pdf/schematic.pdf   reason: doc-only re-release, board unchanged`), or pass
`--allow-identical pdf/schematic.pdf`. An exception without a reason in the
file is itself rejected — a waiver needs evidence, not a bare path.

    """LEGIBLE-BOM mode's EXTRA assertion: the one permitted fab/ change is
    `fab/bom.csv` gaining LEGIBILITY — and NOTHING else about it moving.

    WHY THIS MODE EXISTS, AND WHY THE THREE THAT PRECEDE IT DO NOT COVER IT.
    Canon F-LEGIBLE (ADR-0006) says a fab artifact is graded as its RECIPIENT
    parses it. Fixing a BOM to satisfy it EDITS every row — an MPN appears in a
    column that was blank, a Comment stops being an LCSC code or a `simple_*`
    placeholder — while the board, the gerbers, the drills, the CPL, the STEP
    and the PDFs are byte-identical. `--docs-only-supersede` correctly refuses
    (fab/ changed). `--bom-only-supersede` correctly refuses too, and for a
    reason worth keeping: it FAILs on any EDITED row, because for the defect IT
    guards (canon A-POP, an unplaced part must leave the BOM) an edited row
    would mean a different board.

    WHAT THIS ASSERTS THAT "the file differs" CANNOT. The row IDENTITY is
    frozen: same set of designator-groups, and for each group the SAME
    Footprint and the SAME LCSC code. Only `Comment` and `MPN` may move. So a
    legibility pass cannot smuggle in a substituted part number (the C82317 ->
    C131025 class this repo has already been bitten by), a re-grouped
    designator, a dropped part, or a footprint change — and it cannot smuggle
    OUT a row either. The MPN may only move from BLANK to a value, or between
    two spellings of the same part; it may not be blanked.

    AND THE POINT OF THE RELEASE IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED: the new BOM must
    PASS `bom_legibility_check`, and the prior one must FAIL it. A "legible
    BOM" supersede whose BOM is still illegible supersedes nothing, and one
    whose predecessor was ALREADY legible had no defect to fix.

    `fab/bom.csv` moving `MPN` + `LCSC` on the SUBSTITUTED rows, and nothing
    else about the payload moving at all.

    WHY THIS MODE EXISTS (canon M8, the two-strike promotion). JLC refusing to
    SUPPLY a line is not a design defect and not a paperwork defect: v1.10 of
    usb-hub-3s-v3 was uploaded and line 8 came back "10 shortfall" (C25744, the
    only basic-library 10k 0402, stockCount 0). The fix substitutes an
    electrically identical part at SOURCE and changes NO copper. None of the
    four earlier modes covers it — docs-only requires fab/ byte-identical,
    cpl-only permits only coordinates, bom-only only ROW REMOVAL, and
    legible-bom explicitly FAILs a changed LCSC because when it was written a
    changed LCSC could only be the C82317 -> C131025 accident. So v1.11 shipped
    gated by SEVEN hand-written file waivers, each carrying its own measurement
    — weaker evidence than the release it superseded, because a waiver is a
    human's claim and this is all machine-checkable. crow-recorder-central-v2
    v1.7 is the second board needing it, which under M8 makes promotion
    MANDATORY rather than optional.

    WHAT IS ASSERTED, none of it waivable:

      * the `.kicad_pcb` is BYTE-IDENTICAL, and the md5 is PRINTED (on a board
        whose v1.6-v1.8 shipped 44287.91 mm2 of MISSING COPPER with every gate
        green, "the copper did not move" is the claim that most needs a number);
      * `fab/cpl.csv` is BYTE-IDENTICAL — a substitution to a different package
        would move the placement datum, so an unchanged CPL is what makes
        "drop-in" mean something;
      * every gerber and drill is identical after stripping ONLY the plot's own
        timestamps — which ACCEPTS a re-plot from this release's own board, the
        stronger evidence, instead of demanding a byte-copy;
      * `fab/bom.csv` keeps its ROW COUNT and its designator groups IN THE SAME
        ORDER, and on every row the ONLY cells permitted to move are `MPN` and
        `LCSC`, together, on the substituted rows. A `Comment` or `Footprint`
        change is a different board. An `MPN` moving where the `LCSC` did not is
        a LEGIBILITY edit and belongs in `--legible-bom-supersede`;
      * no row is left with a BLANK `MPN` or a blank/malformed `LCSC`, and the
        new BOM PASSES `bom_legibility_check` (ONE grader, canon M1 — this file
        does not get its own opinion about what "legible" means);
      * the SOURCE moved too (canon M3): a `fab/bom.csv` that changed without
        its `.tsx` changing is a HAND-EDITED BOM — the defect crow-mic-pod-v2
        paid for on 2026-07-27;
      * and BOTH codes of every substitution — the one leaving and the one
        arriving — are NAMED in the release's own MANIFEST or order README, so
        the diff is auditable by someone who was not here.

    """VALUE-CHANGE mode's EXTRA assertion: a part's VALUE moved on parts that
    are already placed, so the ASSEMBLY DATA moves and the COPPER does not.

    WHY THIS MODE EXISTS, AND WHY NO EARLIER MODE COVERS IT. Measured on
    crow-mic-pod-v2 v1.3, 2026-07-28 (`08_reviews/`, the CAL-1 re-derivation):
    `export_jlc_package.py` reads `val = fp.GetValue()` **from the board** and
    feeds that ONE string to BOTH the BOM `Comment` column and the CPL `Val`
    column. So changing a divider from 22k to 33k on two already-placed 0603
    resistors moves the `.kicad_pcb`, the `.kicad_sch`, the `.net`, 2 CPL `Val`
    cells and the BOM rows for those refs — while **all 11 gerbers and drills
    are byte-identical** (verified 11/11, the method validated by re-plotting
    the sealed v1.3 zip from its own archived board). `--docs-only-supersede`
    refuses (fab/ changed). `--bom-only-supersede` refuses (it permits only row
    REMOVAL, and these refs ARE on the CPL). `--legible-bom-supersede` refuses
    (a changed LCSC is a substitution to it). `--sourcing-supersede` refuses
    (it demands an md5-identical board and a byte-identical CPL — a value
    change moves both). `--cpl-only-supersede` names a `Val` change as its own
    explicit exclusion. Without this mode the only way to seal a
    copper-identical value fix is to hand-edit a CSV, which canon M3 forbids.

    WHAT IS ASSERTED, none of it waivable:

      * **the COPPER did not move**, stated the strong way: every gerber and
        drill is identical after stripping ONLY the plot's own timestamps
        (`_PLOT_TS_RE`, incl. the Excellon `; DRILL file ... date` header that
        a first pass on usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.11 missed — it read 11/15 until the
        drill date was covered). That ACCEPTS a re-plot from this release's own
        board, which is stronger evidence than a byte-copy. A release with no
        gerber/drill to compare cannot make the claim at all and FAILs;
      * **the SOURCE moved** (canon M3, in the direction this mode needs it).
        A value is carried BY the board and BY the schematic, so an unchanged
        `source/*.kicad_pcb` or `*.kicad_sch` means the CSVs were HAND-EDITED.
        Both md5s are PRINTED. Editing the board alone is not a way out: the
        measurement recorded `kicad-cli pcb drc --schematic-parity` returning
        2 `footprint_symbol_mismatch` violations for exactly that shortcut;
      * **the CPL delta is `Val` cells and NOTHING else** — identical row
        count, identical designator sequence, and for every ref every
        coordinate, rotation, layer and package cell unchanged. A moved
        coordinate is `--cpl-only-supersede`'s defect (A-POS) and a moved
        rotation is A-ROT's; neither may ride along here;
      * **every moved cell belongs to a DECLARED designator.** The caller
        names the refs (`--designators R4,R5`) and a change touching any other
        ref FAILs. The list must also not be WIDER than the delta: a declared
        ref that moved nothing is padding, and a strip list too wide is as
        wrong as one too narrow;
      * **the BOM ref set is FROZEN** — rows may split or merge around the new
        values (the exporter groups by `(code, val, footprint)`), but no
        designator may be added or dropped. That is A-POP's business and
        `--bom-only-supersede`'s mode;
      * **a declared ref's `Footprint` may not move** (a different land
        pattern is a different board), and its `LCSC` MUST move. A different
        value is a different part: a row whose `Comment` claims 33 kΩ against
        the 22 kΩ part's code is the R12/R30 wrong-part class verbatim, and it
        is exactly what a board-only edit produces;
      * **the two artifacts AGREE** — each declared ref's new CPL `Val` appears
        as a token in its own BOM `Comment` (the exporter writes one merged
        `a / b` Comment when two values share a code+footprint, so containment
        is the honest form of "same string"). They come from one `GetValue()`
        call; a disagreement means one of the two CSVs was written by hand;
      * the new BOM **PASSES `bom_legibility_check`** (taken from the F-LEGIBLE
        gate itself, never re-implemented — ONE grader, canon M1);
      * and **both the OLD and the NEW value of every declared designator are
        NAMED in MANIFEST.txt or the order README**, so the reason this
        release exists is legible to someone who was not here.

    WHY THIS MODE EXISTS. A wrong CPL coordinate is the one defect that is
    100% assembly data and 0% copper: crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.4 shipped
    its only USB-C 1.3025mm off its own pads (canon A-POS) because the
    exporter emitted KiCad's footprint ANCHOR instead of JLC's pad-array
    placement datum. Fixing it changes fab/cpl.csv and NOTHING else — the
    gerbers, drills, BOM, STEP, PDFs and the board itself are byte-identical
    — so docs-only mode correctly refuses, and bom-only mode does not cover
    it either.

    WHAT THIS ASSERTS THAT IDENTITY CANNOT. A rotation is not a coordinate.
    The v1.3 -> v1.4 supersede WAS a CPL-only change and it moved seven
    rotations; had it also smuggled a coordinate, or vice versa, no gate
    would have separated the two. So this mode permits Mid X/Y to move and
    FAILs on any Rotation, Layer, Val or Package change, and on any ADDED
    row. A removed row must be a part that is genuinely off the assembly:
    its designator must not reappear anywhere in the CPL.

# A-STOCK — a release seals only against stock evidence that PASSES.
#
# Five sealed releases in this fleet ship stock evidence whose LAST LINE says
# FAIL, including crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.0-v1.3 whose own CPU
# (C6938291, the XU316 SoC) is recorded LOW_STOCK(0). Nothing ever read the
# verdict, so "stock verified" in the MANIFEST meant only that the tool ran.
# Worse, the fleet ships THREE incompatible evidence formats — stdout text, a
# `--out` CSV report saved as stock_check.txt (cooksense v1.1, ZERO verdict
# lines), and a stdout dump saved as .csv — so a parser that gives up on an
# unfamiliar shape is a parser that can be silenced by choosing a shape.
#
# Therefore: a MISSING or UNPARSEABLE VERDICT IS A FAIL, NOT A SKIP. The one
# legitimate way past a non-OK line is an assembly.yaml `sourcing_plan:` entry
# carrying the MEASURED stock and the date it was measured.
#
# This check is OFFLINE: it grades the EVIDENCE the release ships. Live
# re-query stays in the opt-in `--net` tier — a gate that needs the network
# is a gate that gets skipped.
