"""A-POP — the population set is DECLARED, not emergent.

    assembly_coverage.py TARGET [--assembly PATH] [--json OUT]

`TARGET` is a sealed release directory (`07_releases/<ver>-<date>/`, read
READ-ONLY) or a project directory (`04_kicad/` + `06_build/fab/`).

WHY THIS EXISTS. "Which parts does JLC actually place?" had no machine home.
It was an emergent property of three artifacts that nothing compared:

  * the BOARD's `exclude_from_pos_files` attributes,
  * `fab/cpl.csv` (what the machine is told to place),
  * and a PROSE `not_assembled:` sentence in the release MANIFEST.

Measured on sealed bytes (2026-07-25):

  cooksense v1.1  — 13 CPL placement rows whose BOM line carries a BLANK
    LCSC (J_TC + the twelve K_* Standex reed relays). JLC was told to place
    12 parts the MANIFEST declares not_assembled, and to source a 13th
    (J_TC) declared nowhere at all. Every gate green.
  cooksense interposer v1.0 — a blank-LCSC BOM row whose refs are ALSO on
    the CPL, no `not_assembled:` line anywhere, and a disposition that is
    PROSE telling a human to delete rows before uploading.
  crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.3 — MANIFEST `not_assembled: ... U1 (XU316
    consign)` while U1 sits ON the CPL. Consigned means YOU ship the part
    and JLC PLACES it: a sourcing class, not a population class.

INDEPENDENCE (canon M1). The population delta is computed from the BOARD's
own text and the CPL bytes — never from `export_jlc_package.py`'s filter
logic, which is what produced the CPL in the first place. `read_footprints()`
below parses the `.kicad_pcb` s-expression directly, so this checker needs no
pcbnew and shares no oracle with the exporter. (Cross-checked against pcbnew
on a real sealed board: 195/195 footprints agree on refdes, footprint name,
orientation, layer, pad count and attribute flags — 0 mismatches. That
agreement is asserted as a test, so the parser cannot rot into a second,
quieter bug.)

FAILS
  NO-ASSEMBLY-DECL       no `03_src/rules/assembly.yaml` while the board has
                         unpopulated parts — "not assembled" with no decision
                         record is a free outcome, which is the whole defect.
  UNDECLARED-UNPOPULATED a board footprint absent from the CPL that no
                         `not_assembled:` entry and no declared
                         `exempt_prefixes:` accounts for.
  DECLARED-BUT-PLACED    a ref declared not-assembled that is still ON the
                         CPL — the declaration and the machine instruction
                         disagree, and the machine wins.
  DECLARED-NOT-EXCLUDED  a declared-unpopulated ref whose board footprint
                         does NOT carry `exclude_from_pos_files` — it will
                         come back onto the CPL at the next export.
  POS-ATTR-VS-CPL        the BOARD says exclude-from-pos but the shipped CPL
                         places it anyway: the CPL predates the board.
  UNCODED-ON-CPL         a BOM row with a BLANK LCSC whose refs are on the
                         CPL (the cooksense 13) — JLC cannot source it.
  CPL-NO-BOM-ROW         a placed designator with no BOM line at all.
  BAD-REASON / NO-EVIDENCE / CONSIGN-AS-UNPOPULATED
                         schema failures in `assembly.yaml` itself.
  MANIFEST-UNDECLARED    a release with unpopulated parts and no MANIFEST
                         `not_assembled:` line.
  MANIFEST-DRIFT         the MANIFEST's `not_assembled:` set differs from
                         `assembly.yaml`'s — it is GENERATED from that file,
                         never hand-written in two places.

Exit 0 = the population set is fully declared; 1 = at least one FAIL.
Plain python3 (NO pcbnew).

    """A-POS — every CPL ref is placeable by the process actually ORDERED.

    A part with plated DRILLED pads and NO paste on any of them cannot be
    reflowed: there is no solder in the barrel and none on the land. On an
    order declaring `service: standard` / `sides: [top]` (SMT only, no
    selective-solder or wave line bought), such a ref on the CPL is an
    instruction the assembler cannot execute — they re-quote with an
    unbudgeted hand-solder line, or they silently drop the part.

    crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.4 shipped J1 — a true THT barrel jack, and
    the board's ONLY power inlet — on a top-side-SMT-only CPL, while its own
    assembly.yaml asserted in writing that "the only other THT parts are
    already off the CPL". Nothing compared the sentence to the bytes.

    Pin-in-paste (intrusive reflow) is CORRECTLY exempt: J2 on that same
    board has 4 drilled shell posts that all carry F.Paste, so paste is
    printed into the barrels and it reflows with everything else. The
    discriminator is paste coverage, never the `through_hole` attribute —
    which is why this check reads pad layers rather than `(attr through_hole)`.

    THE THROUGH-HOLE PROCESS, WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY BOUGHT (2026-07-26).
    Until now this check could only be satisfied by taking the part OFF the CPL,
    which is wrong for a board that PAID for through-hole assembly: leaving J1-J4
    on the CPL is the entire point of buying the line. `service:` was read but
    never decided on — it was interpolated into the message and otherwise ignored —
    so usb-hub-3s-v3, whose `service:` names "THROUGH-HOLE assembly (4 refdes / 22
    plated holes)", still failed on all five connectors. Its own assembly.yaml had
    already recorded the gap in writing ("this schema has no dedicated
    through_hole: key ... raised as a skill/template change, PCBA-9").

    The exemption is now a DECLARATION, not a string match on prose:

        through_hole:
          process: "JLCPCB through-hole assembly (selective/wave), ordered"
          refs: [J1, J2, J3, J4, J5]
          evidence: "<dated measurement: hole census + what was ordered>"

    All three keys are REQUIRED and a ref must be NAMED. Silence stays a FAIL,
    an empty `refs` exempts nothing, and a ref not on the list is still caught —
    so the crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.4 case (a THT barrel jack on a top-side-SMT
    CPL, with assembly.yaml asserting in prose that THT parts were off the CPL)
    still fails exactly as it did. Prose cannot buy a process; a declaration with
    evidence can, and it is checkable.
