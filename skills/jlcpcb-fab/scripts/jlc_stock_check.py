"""Check a JLC-format BOM against the JLCPCB parts library.

    python3 jlc_stock_check.py bom.csv [--search-missing] [--min-stock 5]
                               [--min-surplus 150]

                               [--candidates 3]

Plain python3 (no pcbnew needed). BOM columns: Comment,Designator,Footprint,LCSC.

THE VERDICT LINE IS THE CATALOG GATE (legacy canon A-STOCK). It is a cheap
candidate filter, never JLCPCB PCBA availability or allocation. Five sealed releases in this
fleet ship stock evidence whose last line says FAIL — one with the board's own
CPU at stock 0 — because nothing ever parsed it, and the fleet ships THREE
incompatible evidence formats (this script's stdout, its `--out` CSV report,
and a `.csv` file that is really stdout). `--json OUT` writes the ONE
machine-readable sidecar `release_freshness_check.py` grades: per-line
`{lcsc, qty, status, stock}` plus an explicit `verdict`. Ship it in
`07_releases/<rel>/verification/stock_check.json`; a MISSING or UNPARSEABLE
verdict is a FAIL there, never a skip.

- Lines WITH an LCSC code: exact lookup -> stock, basic/extended, price.
  Exit 1 if any coded line is not found or stock is below
  `min-stock * aggregate-line-qty + min-surplus`.
- Lines WITHOUT a code (--search-missing): keyword search from Comment +
  package token; candidates ranked basic-first then stock-desc. These are
  PROPOSALS for a human to confirm — the ranking can't see V/tol/temp specs.
- Unofficial endpoint (verified 2026-07); ~1.2s between calls, don't
  parallelize. Fallback if it breaks: github yaqwsx/jlcparts mirror.
