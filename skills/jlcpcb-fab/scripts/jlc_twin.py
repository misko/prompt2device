"""JLC digital twin: verify that what JLCPCB will assemble matches our board.

For every BOM line with an LCSC code, fetch JLC's OWN footprint + 3D model
(easyeda2kicad), then:
  1. pad-correspondence: best-fit our footprint's pads against JLC's over
     rotation {0,90,180,270} x mirror. MIRRORED fit = mirror-numbered land
     pattern = dead board (this check found a live one on its first run).
  2. rotation audit: the fitted angle IS the CPL rotation offset JLC needs;
     compare against jlc_rotations_db.csv and print suggested rows.
  3. twin render: mount JLC's 3D models on OUR board at the fitted transform
     and render top/bottom - a local preview of what JLC's viewer will show.

usage: jlc_twin.py board.kicad_pcb bom.csv outdir [--cpl fab/cpl.csv]
Exit 1 on any MIRRORED, PAD-MISMATCH, PAD-GEOM, MODEL-REG, P-MATE-REG,
NO-BODY or POLARITY-FIT finding.

MOUNTED ON A FIT IT HAD JUST REJECTED (2026-07-26). On PAD-MISMATCH this tool
recorded "no correspondence" and then mounted the body at that same rejected
fit's angle, so the render — the artifact a human is explicitly told to inspect
("VERIFY leads sit on pads visually") — was corrupted by the failure it was
supposed to help adjudicate. crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.5: J2, the board's
only USB-C, reported `PAD-MISMATCH best=(4.5947, False, 90)` and rendered 90
DEGREES ROTATED (7.555 x 8.940 mm where the part is 8.940 x 7.555) into two
sealed releases and past four review lenses. A failed fit is not evidence of an
angle; the mount now falls back to JLC's OWN footprint transform — offset 0,
their model rot_z, which this file already reads and already calls
"authoritative" — and says so as MOUNT-FALLBACK. The render is now gated
against that transform by `twin_overlay.py` (canon A-RENDER), which measures
the body in PIXELS so it cannot agree with a wrong mount by construction.

MOUNT HANDEDNESS INCIDENT (2026-07-25) — the SECOND half of the bug below.
Fixing `xform()` in 1b69760 left FOUR more hand-inlined copies of the wrong
form: the render mount's offset, its z-rotation, and the model-frame rotation
in BOTH `reg_check()` and `model_self_check()`. Because MODEL-REG used the
same wrong form as the mount, it graded the mount with the mount's own method
(canon M1, again) — so a TRUE 14.37 mm finding on a shipped XT60 was waived as
a false alarm and usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.5 sealed with every 90/270 part rendered
180 deg out. All five sites now route through ONE operator each
(`xform` / `local_to_board` / `model_rot`), each pinned against an authority
outside this file: pcbnew for pad geometry, `kicad-cli pcb render` for the
model frame. `board_to_local()` is a LEGITIMATE inverse whose literal text
matches the bug — match on the FRAMES a site maps between, never on the
expression.

HANDEDNESS INCIDENT (2026-07-25) — `xform()` was WRONG and every `jlc_offset`
this tool reported before that date is NEGATED. `xform()` used the opposite
handedness to `local_to_board()`. Measured against pcbnew itself over 72 pads
on rotated footprints (`pad.GetFPRelativePosition()` vs `pad.GetPosition()`):
local_to_board's form is EXACT (max error 0.000000 mm on all 72); the old
xform form was off by up to 23.926763 mm, losing every 90 deg sample (26) and
every 270 deg sample (4) and tying at 180 (42), where the two forms are
mathematically identical. That tie is why it hid for so long: 0/180 are
sign-invariant, 90/270 negate into each other, so the error was invisible on
more than half the fleet and exactly 180 deg wrong on the rest.

Consequences, all paid: six rows of `jlc_lcsc_rotations.csv` had been
populated FROM this function and were all 180 deg wrong; a SEALED release that
was correct (crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.2) was "fixed" into a wrong one
(v1.3) on that evidence; and an external reviewer reading the table was misled
by it. Canon M1, twice over — the authority table WAS the checker's output, so
every consumer inherited the same negation and nothing independent could
object.

STILL HELD as a consequence: promoting ROT-DB-SUGGEST to blocking, and the
A-ROT release gate. Neither may rank this table as AUTHORITY. A rotation gate
must re-derive the angle from the BOARD plus JLC's cached model with an
operator VERIFIED against pcbnew — never from `jlc_offset`, and never from a
table populated by it. The fix is pinned by `t1_jlc_twin.py`
(`t_xform_matches_pcbnew`, `t_fit_offset_handedness`), both RED-verified
against the pre-fix form.

Checks beyond the fit itself:
  - PAD-GEOM: pairwise pad-center distances (rotation/translation-invariant,
    so no best-fit can smear them) must agree between our footprint and
    JLC's within PAD_GEOM_TOL. A disagreement means the two land patterns
    differ dimensionally - the model WILL render off our pads by part of
    that delta, and someone must decide which pattern matches the part
    datasheet (adjudicate with evidence). Found via a DPAK whose tab-to-lead
    distance differed 0.65mm; the fit split it into an unexplained 0.43mm
    residual (2026-07-16).
  - NO-BODY (BLOCKING, own adjudication key): after mounting, every CPL
    designator is walked, its 3D model path expanded through KiCad's OWN
    ${VAR} table, and required to be a file with size > 0. Deliberately
    independent of the fit path — it asks the filesystem, not the fitter.
    Headline `bodies mounted: N/M`, and `missing_models.txt` is GENERATED
    from this pass. A PAD-MISMATCH / FETCH-FAILED waiver CANNOT discharge it.
  - PAD-MULTIPLICITY (non-fatal): a pad number named a different number of
    times on the two footprints. Those numbers are fitted by CENTROID instead
    of discarding the whole part (which is what used to happen).
  - POLARITY-CHECK: 2-pad polarized parts (electrolytics, diodes, LEDs)
    where 0 and 180 fit the pads equally - the pad fit cannot orient the
    model, so its polarity marking in the render is unverified and must be
    checked against our silk + the JLC order preview.
  - --assembly 03_src/rules/assembly.yaml: pull the ref->LCSC pairs for
    parts that are CODED but NOT ASSEMBLED (and for consigned parts) out of
    the ONE declared home, so those bodies render and their land patterns are
    checked too. This REPLACES hand-typing `--also REF=LCSC`: a hand-typed
    list is a second home for the population set and drifts from the first
    (cooksense v1.1's MANIFEST and CPL disagreed on 12 refs for exactly that
    reason). `--also` still works for an ad-hoc probe.
    A not-assembled entry may instead declare `twin_body: {source: board}`
    to retain the board footprint's exact local model, or
    `twin_body: {source: file, model: PATH}` to mount a project-owned model.
    These manual-install bodies are included in the NO-BODY denominator even
    though they are deliberately absent from the CPL. A declared local body
    always wins over an LCSC code: a catalog near-match must never replace the
    intended mechanical body merely because it can be fetched.
  - --also REF=LCSC[,REF=LCSC..]: include hand-solder/uncoded parts with
    known LCSC codes so their bodies render too (connector overhang and
    orientation checks otherwise never run for exactly the parts a human
    solders by eye).
