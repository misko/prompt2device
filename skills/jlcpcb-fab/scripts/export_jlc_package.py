"""JLC order package: gerbers + drills + BOM + CPL + upload zip.

    /usr/bin/python3 export_jlc_package.py BOARD.kicad_pcb OUTDIR [--layers 4]

Run with the KiCad-bundled interpreter (import pcbnew must work).
Run only AFTER the audit gate and classified DRC pass (kicad-pcb skill).

- The zip contains gerbers + drills + job file ONLY (JLC's PCB uploader);
  bom.csv / cpl.csv upload separately in the assembly step.
- Parts whose Value contains "DNP" are excluded from BOM/CPL (still in
  gerbers). Reference prefix H* is skipped as mounting holes.
- LCSC part numbers come from the AUTHORITATIVE per-refdes source
  (circuit.json `supplier_part_numbers`, auto-discovered or --lcsc-source),
  and the BOM is grouped by (LCSC code, footprint) — so two distinct codes on
  the same value+footprint stay on SEPARATE rows and a code can never be
  substituted by a value-token match (the usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.1 defect). A prior
  bom.csv is only a per-refdes FALLBACK for parts the source does not code.
- Bottom-side CPL coordinates are NOT mirrored (JLC handles that), but
  bottom ROTATIONS are the classic failure — check the assembly preview.
- A declared selective ``via_process.order_remark`` is emitted verbatim as
  ``order_notes.txt`` beside the upload files.  Gerber does not carry KiCad's
  per-item fill/cap attributes, so this generated instruction is part of the
  manufacturing package even though it is not inside the PCB upload zip.
- The BOM is graded as its RECIPIENT parses it (canon F-LEGIBLE, ADR-0006):
  the MPN comes from `02_parts/<MPN>/part.yaml` (the dossier's `mpn:` field,
  then the vetted passives ledger) and a coded row resolving NO MPN BLOCKS;
  the Comment is a real value, never an LCSC code or a `simple_*` placeholder;
  and the file carries a UTF-8 byte-order-mark so a cp936 reader cannot render
  `Ω` as `惟`. `lcsc_mpn_map.csv` is RETIRED as an input.

THE ASSEMBLY FILES ARE NAMED `bom.csv` AND `cpl.csv`, AND THAT IS THE CONTRACT'S
NAME, NOT A PREFERENCE. `07_releases/contracts.md` requires `fab/bom.csv` +
`fab/cpl.csv` and all 34 sealed releases carry those names; this exporter wrote
`bom_jlc.csv`/`cpl_jlc.csv` and every seal bridged the gap by HAND-COPYING. The
hand-copy is what made the mismatch invisible — and on pluto-rx2-8way-v2 the
copy did not happen, so the staged archive shipped the exporter's names. The
consequence was not a cosmetic file-not-found: `release_freshness_check.py`
resolves A-STOCK and A-BUY through `fab/bom.csv`, so with the name absent both
gates reached a ZERO DENOMINATOR and emitted NOTES — "no coded, placed line to
grade" and "sourcing UNGRADED — 0 line(s) measured" — instead of failures.
Two gates that exist BECAUSE five sealed releases shipped failing stock
evidence went silent over an empty set (measured 2026-07-31; adding only the
two correctly-named copies flips them to `11 graded line(s), verdict=PASS` /
`SOURCING: CLEAR`). A producer that does not emit the name its consumers
resolve is the defect, not the consumers.

LEGACY `bom_jlc.csv`/`cpl_jlc.csv` in the OUTDIR are read for LCSC carry-over
(so an existing 06_build/fab/ still seeds hand-solder codes) and then REMOVED,
on the success path as well as the two block paths. Leaving them is the same
failure the block paths already guard: a plausible-looking uploadable file that
is not the one this run produced.

    """JLC's placement datum for a footprint, in BOARD coordinates.

    JLC places a part so that ITS OWN part origin lands on the CPL's Mid X/Y.
    That origin is NOT KiCad's footprint anchor — it is the CENTRE OF THE
    BOUNDING BOX OF THE PAD CENTRES.

    MEASURED, not assumed (2026-07-25, crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.5). Over
    228 cached EasyEDA/JLC-native footprints across six boards of this fleet,
    the model origin sits on its own pad-centre bbox centre to <=0.01mm in
    227 cases (99.6%). The single outlier, C464587, is a part already recorded
    as NOT a land drop-in. Two weaker hypotheses were tested on the same 228
    and REFUTED: bbox of pad OUTLINES 213/228 (93.4%) and CENTROID of pad
    centres 198/228 (86.8%). Both fail on exactly the connectors that matter,
    because a connector's pads differ in size and count between rows.

    The anchor is a KiCad authoring convenience with no fab meaning, and on
    this fleet it differs from the datum on 12/203, 12/227, 12/114, 14/238,
    2/40 and 1/39 footprints per board — up to 24.16mm. It was emitted here
    for the fleet's whole history. The defect that found it: crow-recorder-
    central-v2 v1.4 shipped its only USB-C (J2) 1.3025mm off, against 1.150mm
    contacts -> 0.000mm pad overlap and four shell posts that miss their
    holes, i.e. a connector that cannot physically seat.

    CROSS-CHECKED against JLC's own models by a numbering-free landmark fit
    (pad names never read) on the two affected refs of that board:
      J1 C381116  our pad lattice maps onto JLC's exactly, rms 0.0000mm ->
                  datum at local (-3.000, +2.350); this function returns the
                  same point to 0.0000mm.
      J2 C3020560 three independent landmark families agree: shell posts
                  -1.295, NPTH pegs -1.275, SMD contact row -1.310; this
                  function returns -1.3025, inside that 0.035mm spread.

    Copper pads only, which is JLC's own convention: their models carry the
    plastic-peg holes as copper-layer pads too, and including them is what
    reproduces 227/228. Falls back to the anchor for a footprint with no
    copper pads (mounting holes, fiducials) — those are never on the CPL.

    JLC's BOM/CPL matcher". That removal was made IN THE ARTIFACT: re-running

    SOURCED.

    IT IS NOT DERIVABLE FROM `reason:`, and that was tried first. usb-hub-3s-v3
    declares F1 `user_supplied` and F1 IS on its BOM (the holder ships with the
    order at stock 1213; only the fuse ELEMENT is bought locally). crow-mic-pod-v2
    declares MK1 and J1 `user_supplied` and both must LEAVE the BOM. Same reason
    code, opposite BOM answer, because `reason:` records WHY a part is not
    placed and this records whether JLC is asked to source it. A rule inferred
    from `reason:` would have silently dropped usb-hub-3s-v3's fuse holder.

# silent default, the exact `row_kind` shape canon M-COVER forbids. Only ONE
# project ever created that file, so eight of nine boards shipped 100% blank
# MPN and nothing noticed: 914 of 1205 sealed BOM rows fleet-wide. The
# author had ALREADY DIAGNOSED the symptom in this file's own comment ("a
# Comment like 'LM5145' left C485912 at 'No Part Selected'; 'LM5145RGYR'
# matches") and then made the remedy opt-in. A known remedy behind an opt-in
# flag is not a remedy.

# The authoritative MPN was in the tree the whole time: `02_parts/<MPN>/
