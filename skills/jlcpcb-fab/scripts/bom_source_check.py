"""BOM-vs-source consistency gate: the fab BOM's per-refdes LCSC code MUST
equal the SOURCE's per-refdes LCSC code. Nothing else is a legitimate BOM.

Why this exists (the defect it would have blocked)
--------------------------------------------------
usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.1 shipped a corrupt orderable BOM. The board carries only a
Value string per footprint ("10uF"), never the LCSC code; the exporter grouped
footprints by (value, footprint) and re-attached a code by value-token lookup.
So two DISTINCT parts that share a value+footprint collapsed onto one row:

  source: C9-C12,C24-C27 = C77102 (10uF *50V*)   C49,C50 = C77100 (10uF *25V*)
  shipped BOM: all ten on ONE row coded C77100 (25V) — 50V input caps became
               25V caps on the input rail.

and the output cap was SUBSTITUTED: source C84455 (10V) -> BOM C90143 (16V).

A merged row, a substituted code, or a blank code where the source has one are
all silent BOM corruption. This gate is the machine backstop.

The source of truth (canon M6: authoritative source, not a downstream copy)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
`circuit.json` `source_component.supplier_part_numbers.jlcpcb[0]`, keyed by
refdes (the component `name`). This is emitted from the tscircuit source
(`supplierPartNumbers`) — the SAME declaration a human reads in the .tsx — and
is per-refdes, so it can represent two different codes on one value+footprint
that the KiCad board physically cannot.

Two INDEPENDENT legs (canon M1: checker and checked must not share a method):
  A. per-refdes, vs circuit.json  — catches MERGED / SUBSTITUTED / MISSING.
     Authoritative and independent of HOW the BOM was produced (the v1.1
     corruption happened in a value-token carry-over downstream of the source).
  B. per-vendored-code, vs 02_parts/*/part.yaml (optional) — the OTHER
     direction, from a hand-maintained source that never reads circuit.json:
     every part we deliberately VENDORED (has a part.yaml) AND that the build
     actually uses must appear on the BOM under its vetted `sourcing.lcsc`. A
     substituted or dropped code makes its vetted code ABSENT from the BOM
     (C84455 was vendored; the v1.1 BOM shipped C90143 and C84455 is nowhere).
     Iterates the ~dozens of vendored parts, NOT every BOM row, so a passive
     coded from JLC's basic library with no part.yaml is never a false positive.

Leg C — SEMANTIC value consistency (usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.2, 2026-07-23)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Legs A/B check CODE IDENTITY only (BOM code == source code). They are BLIND to
what the LCSC code actually IS in the catalog. v1.2 shipped R12 = C2933210 (MPN
FRC0603F3741TS = 3.74 kOhm) while the row LABEL said "4.12kOhm" — driving the
buck-C setpoint to ~4.97 V undervoltage. Code identity PASSED; the value was
wrong. This gate now also compares the MPN-ENCODED value to the LABELED value.

Resistor/cap MPNs encode value as EIA 3-sig-fig + multiplier (FRC0603F3741TS ->
"3741" -> 374 x 10^1 = 3.74 kOhm; a real 4.12k encodes "4121" -> 412 x 10^1 =
4120) or as RKM notation ("4K12" = 4.12k, "2R2" = 2.2Ohm). Resolution order for
every R/C row: the BOM's MPN column -> the vendored part.yaml directory name
(the dir IS the MPN) -> the vetted LCSC ledger
(references/lcsc_passives_ledger.yaml, {code: {mpn, value, verified}} — the
proven-parts pattern: pay the catalog verification ONCE, ever). The first
source that yields a value wins; the comparison is OFFLINE. An R/C row with an
LCSC code that NONE of the three resolves is FLAGGED for manual review — an
unverifiable value is NOT a pass; catalog-verify the code once and append it to
the ledger, then it is quiet forever. The ledger matters because the REAL fab
BOMs ship a BLANK MPN column and basic-library passives carry no part.yaml: on
the sealed v1.2 artifact the first two sources resolve NOTHING, and without the
ledger R12 stays silent (measured 2026-07-23). This leg needs no network; a
catalog fetch, if present, is a bonus not a dependency.

--circuit-only — leg C at the AUTHORING stage (no fab BOM yet, 2026-07-23)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The R12/R30 class was AUTHORED in the tsx (a supplierPartNumbers code whose
catalog value never matched the declared resistance) and first caught after
seal #3, because leg C only ran once a fab BOM existed. `--circuit-only`
runs the same decoded-MPN-value-vs-label comparison DIRECTLY on circuit.json
the moment the tsx builds: for every R/C source_component that carries an
LCSC code, the code's catalog value (via 02_parts part.yaml MPN dirs, then
the vetted ledger) must match the component's own value prop (`resistance` /
`capacitance` — the number the tsx declared). No BOM, no netlist, no network.

    bom_source_check.py --circuit-only CIRCUIT_JSON [--parts 02_parts] [--ledger Y]

Same semantics as leg C: a mismatch > 1.5% is VALUE-MISMATCH; a coded R/C
that NO source resolves is UNVERIFIABLE-VALUE (an unverifiable value is not
a pass — vet the code once, append it to the ledger, quiet forever). The
NUMERIC prop is authoritative; the display string is only a fallback (display
"10mΩ" would mis-read as MΩ under RKM rules, the numeric 0.01 cannot).

Exit 1 on any finding; the exit code IS the gate.

    """Leg C: catalog value vs LABELED value for every R/C row.

    Resolution order (first source that yields a value wins):
      1. the vetted LCSC ledger's explicit value   (catalog-verified fact)
      2. the BOM's own MPN column                  (heuristic MPN decode)
      3. the vendored part.yaml directory name     (heuristic MPN decode)
      4. the vetted ledger MPN                     (heuristic fallback)

    The explicit ledger value must precede every MPN decoder. Numeric product
    families such as Panasonic ``16SVPF180M`` are valid names but can look like
    EIA capacitance tokens (18 pF) to a heuristic; the exact-code catalog fact
    is stronger evidence than that parse.
    An R/C row with an LCSC code (or an MPN) that NO source resolves is
    UNVERIFIABLE-VALUE — flagged for review, never a silent pass; catalog-
    verify the code once and append it to the ledger. The real fab BOMs ship a
    blank MPN column and basic-library passives have no part.yaml, so on a real
    board the ledger is usually the source that bites (the sealed v1.2 R12 was
    invisible to sources 1 and 2 — measured 2026-07-23).
