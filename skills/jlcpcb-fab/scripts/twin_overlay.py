"""twin_overlay.py — GRADE the twin render: is the PICTURE faithful to the
BOARD? Draws the courtyards too, but the drawing is the by-product.

WHAT THIS FILE USED TO BE, AND WHY THAT WAS WORSE THAN NOTHING (2026-07-26).
It carried a checker's docstring and computed NO BODY POSITION ANYWHERE. It
projected courtyards out of the board and drew boxes; its only non-zero exits
concerned the IMAGE (no green region, anisotropy over tol). It was wired into
no pipeline stage, had no contract Audit row, and had no known-bad fixture —
so nothing could observe that it graded nothing. Run against `twin_bottom.png`
it exited 0 printing "orthographic, projection valid" while drawing all 203
F.CrtYd boxes UN-MIRRORED onto an x-mirrored render (J2's boxes landed 10.0 mm
from its part). That is the `bom_source_check.row_kind` class: a sweep that
silently covers a fraction of its input while printing PASS.

THE PROPERTY THIS GATES, and the two constraints that decide it:

    expected = mesh bbox x JLC's OWN footprint model transform x our board
               placement                                          (GEOMETRY)
    measured = connected-component bbox of the populated-minus-bare
               image delta, or the legacy body-colour classifier when no
               same-camera bare render is supplied                       (PIXELS)
    FAIL if the two disagree by more than --tol

(A) CANON M1 — the checker and the checked must not share a method. The
    artifact under test is the RENDER. If the `measured` side were computed
    analytically from the mesh plus the mount transform, it would share a
    method with `jlc_twin`'s mount and would AGREE WITH A WRONG MOUNT — which
    is precisely the defect that shipped (J2 below). So `measured` comes from
    PIXELS: preferably the changed-pixel component between TWO renders made
    with the same camera and board (models present vs every model removed),
    seeded at the expected centre. This sees green terminal blocks, tan
    capacitors, black moulding and disconnected metal alike; the old
    saturation classifier saw only grey/metal and therefore measured one
    capacitor end cap or one terminal screw as the complete body. Nothing on
    the measured side reads twin.kicad_pcb, twin_report.csv, or any jlc_twin
    geometry output. The bare image is an observation of the renderer, not an
    analytic body expectation.

(B) THE REFERENCE IS THE EXPECTED POSITION, NOT THE COURTYARD. Gating
    body-vs-courtyard makes J1 fail on every run forever — JLC's barrel-jack
    mesh is genuinely 5.686 mm off the courtyard centre because the mesh is
    4.26 mm off its own origin — which produces a waiver, and an inherited
    waiver is how the refdes-on-silk defect propagated across three boards
    (canon M4). Body-vs-courtyard is REPORTED as a model-quality number and
    gates nothing. The classification a reviewer actually needs is:

        body outside courtyard + render faithful  -> MODEL defect, no board
                                                     exposure (J1)
        render disagrees with the geometry        -> the PICTURE is lying, and
                                                     every visual review done
                                                     on it is void (J2)

MEASURED ACCEPTANCE, crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.5 (203 footprints, edge
9.950..180.050 x 9.950..130.050 mm, twin_top.png at 5.6790 px/mm x /
5.6869 px/mm y, anisotropy 0.9986):

  - J1 barrel jack (C381116, anchor 24.0000,102.0000 rot 0): mesh bbox centre
    is model-local (-3.6500,+2.2000); expected body centre (23.200,100.700);
    courtyard centre (18.000,103.000) -> a 5.686 mm courtyard excursion that
    is REPORTED, not gated. Pixel-measured 16.113..30.200 x 96.113..105.256
    against expected 16.000..30.400 x 96.050..105.350: centre delta 0.043 mm,
    outward excursion 0.113 mm. J1 PASSES.
  - J2 USB-C (C3020560, anchor 90.0000,126.0000 rot 0): the pad fit FAILED
    (PAD-MISMATCH best=(4.5947, False, 90), PAD-GEOM pad 1<->2 ours 0.80 mm vs
    JLC 8.64 mm) and jlc_twin mounted the body at that failed fit's 90 deg
    anyway. Expected (JLC's own transform, the only defensible mount for an
    unfitted part) 83.755..92.695 x 119.408..126.963; pixel-measured
    85.491..93.239 x 117.917..126.709 -> centre delta 1.435 mm, outward
    excursion 1.491 mm. J2 FAILS. That is this gate's headline acceptance:
    run it on the SEALED v1.5 render and it fails on J2; run it after the
    jlc_twin mount fix and it passes.

WHY THE TOLERANCE IS 1.00 mm, from the measurement and not from taste. 22 of
this board's 177 refs with an expected body clear the resolvability
precondition. Their readings, with J2 taken out as the known defect (n=21):

    centre delta   median 0.160  max 0.248 (F6)
    outward        median 0.145  max 0.217 (Q1)

and the two ends of the J2 case:

    J2 as SEALED (mounted at the rejected fit)   1.435 / 1.491   <- must FAIL
    J2 after the jlc_twin mount fix              0.543 / 0.025   <- must PASS

So the empty band runs from 0.543 (the largest legitimate reading anywhere on
the board) to 1.435 (the defect), and 1.00 mm is within 0.01 mm of its
arithmetic midpoint. It is 4.0x the worst clean centre delta, 4.6x the worst
clean outward excursion, 0.70x the defect — and 5.68 px at this render scale,
comfortably over the 2 px an erosion/dilation round trip can cost an edge. A
tolerance of 0.50 mm would condemn the CORRECTED J2; 1.50 mm would acquit the
sealed one. The choice is made by the data, not by preference.

CALIBRATION IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED, and a render this tool cannot trust is
REFUSED rather than drawn on: a misleading overlay is believed exactly as
readily as a correct one (the I-HW geodesic encoded the wrong physics rather
than none and was believed because it produced a number). Refusals, all four
measured on this release: no green board region; anisotropy over tol
(twin_iso_nw 0.9458, twin_iso_se 0.9141, twin_edge_west 6.2564 — sampling
every pixel; the old every-second-pixel scan read 0.9499 and 51.9765, refusing
either way); `--side bottom` on a board whose B.CrtYd layer is empty while 203
footprints sit on F.CrtYd; and `--side top` on a file named `twin_bottom.png`,
which is the exact invocation that used to exit 0 while drawing all 203 boxes
un-mirrored. The mirror itself is pinned in pixels: flip J1 to B.Cu and its
B.CrtYd box must land at px x 601.7..658.6 of the synthetic fixture, 459 px
from where the un-mirrored projection would put it.

VACUITY: (canon G-VACUOUS — the input class on which this gate PASSES while the
fact it grades is FALSE, fixtured by `t1_twin_overlay.py`
`t_vacuity_a_body_under_the_resolvability_floor_is_excluded_not_graded`.)

A-RENDER's verdict is `fails = {r: g for r, g in graded.items() if ...}` — over
the GRADED SUBSET only. Two exclusions run BEFORE that dict is built and NEITHER
can fail: `unresolvable` (an expected body under `MIN_BODY_MM = 2.0` in either
dimension, reported as "Not measurable by construction") and `no_model` (no JLC
footprint cached). `unmeasured` — big enough to resolve and no pixels found — is
correctly a hard FAIL; the other two are quiet.

MEASURED on the sealed crow-recorder-central-v2 v1.5 release this suite fixtures
against: `COVERAGE: 2 measured / 23 with an expected body; 21 unresolvable, 0
resolvable-but-unmeasured, 162 no-model, 203 courtyards drawn`. **The verdict
rests on 2 of 203 parts.** So A-RENDER can exit 0 with any 0402 or 0603 on the
board rotated 180 degrees, mis-swapped, or absent — 1.0 x 0.5 mm is under the
2.0 mm floor by construction, and those are exactly the parts that get rotated.
The denominator is printed on every run, which is why this is discoverable at
all; what is missing is any gate that reads it.

A SECOND, SMALLER MOUTH, in the other direction and NOT this gate's vacuity:
`MIN_BODY_PX = 20` and `EROSION = 2` are PIXEL floors sitting beside a
millimetre tolerance (`--tol`, default 1.00 mm), while jlc_twin hard-codes
`--width 1600 --height 1000` — 8.34 px/mm on the 188.1 mm cooksense board.
Measured there: the two A-RENDER FAILs at that scale (`U_LDO` centre delta
1.248 mm, `Q_SWDRVRHA` 13 body px against the floor of 20) BOTH VANISH at
15.3961 px/mm — 0.111 mm and 872 px, exit 0. The render was faithful and the
SEGMENTATION was resolution-limited (cross-checked by an independent PIL column
scan, canon M1). That makes the low-resolution verdict a FALSE FAIL, not a false
pass, so it is a defect to fix and not a vacuity condition; it is recorded here
because the two were reported as one thing and are not.
