# Staged first-article bring-up

Fabrication readiness is not first-power readiness. Before energizing a new
assembly, create `03_src/rules/first_article.yaml` from the power tree,
assembly rules, and footprints. It owns the population stage, exposed pads,
rail probe points, expected unpowered resistance, supply/current limit,
expected voltage/no-load current, and abort ranges.

```text
power tree + footprints + assembly rules -> first_article.yaml
physical inspection + meter readings ----> first_article.json
                                             |
                                             v
                                  AUTHORIZED | HOLD
```

Example:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: regulator-only
    installed: [F1, U2, U11]
    exposed_pads: [U2]
rails:
  - name: 5VA
    resistance: {probe: C17, min_ohm: 1000, max_ohm: 2500}
    voltage: {probe: C17, min_v: 5.0, max_v: 5.3}
    no_load_current: {probe: bench_supply, min_a: 0, max_a: 0.03}
    supply: {probe: bench_supply, min_v: 9.5, max_v: 12.2,
             max_current_limit_a: 0.05}
```

Record readings with explicit units and probe names in
`01_docs/journal/first_article.json`, then run:

```bash
python3 skills/jlcpcb-fab/scripts/first_article_check.py PROJECT \
  --json PROJECT/06_build/first_article_verdict.json
```

Missing evidence or an abnormal value is HOLD. Do not continue powering a
failed board to gather more evidence. Firmware is not generated or required by
this gate unless the project explicitly requests a separate firmware task.

Every `installed` item is one literal reference designator. Ranges such as
`R5-R13`, connector pins such as `J1.1`, and net names are not expanded and are
rejected. `exposed_pads` is the subset of those installed component refdes
whose hidden solder lands need confirmation; ordinary probe pads and nets
belong in the measurement `probe` fields instead. The current schema applies
every declared rail measurement to every population stage, so each stage must
be independently measurable under the complete rail card. Use one explicit
fully populated stage when a partial stage cannot satisfy that contract.
