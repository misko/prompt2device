"""tier_preflight — assert routing/stitch TOOL CONFIG == the DECLARED fab tier.

WHY (2026-07-23, crow-recorder-central-v2). ~60% of that board's routing
stage was spent fighting four defects that were all the SAME defect: a tool
default that silently disagreed with the board's declared fab tier / DRC
floors, each only surfacing as a wall of downstream findings:

  1. generate_rules' hardcoded 0.2mm clearance default vs the tier's ~0.10mm
     expectation -> the router (0.13) routed under the DRC clearance nobody
     had examined: 500 then 158 phantom clearance findings.
  2. via_site_ok() checked only F.Cu/B.Cu, blind to In2/In3 (the layers the
     board's signal routing actually used) -> 200 shorting_items + 501
     clearance findings appeared only after stitch.
  3. stitch.normalize_vias fell back to its own hardcoded 0.6/0.3 default and
     resized 323/323 correctly-sized 0.30mm tier vias, collision-unchecked.
  4. try_via's via tier carried {size,drill} only, so via_site_ok fell back
     to hole_to_copper=0.205 — 0.055mm STRICTER than the board's 0.15mm
     hole_clearance floor -> a FALSE placement wall: 7 of the 8 "unstitchable"
     GND pads had a DRC-legal via site 0.2-0.8mm away the whole time, and the
     miss was first (wrongly) diagnosed as a placement-density D-BACK.

Every 6-layer small-via board will hit these unless the config is CHECKED
against the tier before any KRT cycle is spent. This gate runs as the FIRST
step of route_and_stitch_generic's `route` command (refuse-to-route;
`--skip-preflight` is the loud escape hatch) and standalone:

    python3 tier_preflight.py <project_root> [--explain] [--route-config P]

For every routing/stitch/rescue parameter that has a DRC-floor twin it
computes the EFFECTIVE value (explicit config, or the code default it would
silently ride) and compares it against the declared tier + board DRC floors.
Each mismatch is ONE NAMED LINE with a copy-paste fix; where a default was
never set, the tier-correct value is COMPUTED and printed. `--explain`
prints the derivation for every check, passing ones included.

FAIL (exit 1, blocks route) vs WARN (printed, does not block): a check is a
FAIL when the mismatch has a measured defect class behind it or the config
is explicitly sub-floor; it is a WARN when the risk is real but the full DRC
gate catches it loudly anyway (an under-strict default), or when the twin is
a placement-quality heuristic (legalize), so that proven shipped boards
(cook-loadcell, crow-array-pod) are not retro-blocked.

No pcbnew dependency — `route` runs on the KRT venv, so this reads the
board file as TEXT (the layer table) and the .kicad_pro as JSON.

    THIS GATE MUST SELECT — it grades ONE board's route config — so unlike
    `waiver_provenance.waiver_files()` it cannot simply enumerate. What it can
    do is REFUSE rather than guess, which is `release_index.py`'s rule for the
    same situation ("'the latest' with no board named on a two-board project
    REFUSES"). Three properties, each paid for:

      * A FLAT PATH THAT IS A SYMLINK INTO ONE BOARD'S DIRECTORY IS NAMED AS
        SUCH. MEASURED on smc0985-cooksense 2026-07-30: `03_src/rules/` holds
        FIVE such symlinks — assembly.yaml, electrical_invariants.yaml,
        nets.yaml, policy_waivers.yaml, power_tree.yaml — every one pointing at
        `../cooksense/rules/`. So every gate reading the flat address grades
        the cooksense board while believing it read a project-wide file, and
        `--board interposer` gets cooksense's netclasses. Silent before this.
      * TWO BOARDS AND NO `--board` IS A REFUSAL, not a first-match.
      * NOTHING FOUND returns None with a reason, so the caller can report
        GRADED NOTHING instead of grading invented defaults (which is what
        this gate did: with no route.yaml it fell back to `self.cfg = {}` and
