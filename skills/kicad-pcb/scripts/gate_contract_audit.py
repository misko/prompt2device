"""gate_contract_audit.py — canon G-*: a gate on the gates.

    gate_contract_audit.py [--root DIR] [--json OUT] [--enforce LIST]

WHY THIS EXISTS. `contracts_audit.py` governs FOLDERS. Nothing governed the
CHECKERS, so five of them shipped unable to fail on the property they name, and
a five-release fleet audit (2026-07-26/27) found two boards not orderable with
every gate green. Measured on this repo at the time of writing:

  * A-AMP graded **10 of 57** declared net-class currents fleet-wide. Any
    qualifier ("7 A worst case", "6 A / 5 A", "~1.5A pulsed") made `parse_amps`
    return None, and rules_audit.py then filed it under OKS with the text
    "n/a (no current: declared)". ZERO net classes actually declare no current,
    so that message was wrong 100% of the times it fired. usb-hub-3s-v3 ships
    PWR_IN 7 A, PWR_RAIL 6 A and SWITCH_NODE 7 A — all silenced; the one class
    it did grade, VBUS, FAILED.

    **REPAIRED 2026-07-27 (`rules_audit.py:120-140`), AND THIS PARAGRAPH WENT ON
    ASSERTING THE DEFECT FOR SIX DAYS.** Probe, and the reason every negative
    claim below now carries one (canon G-STALE-NEG):

        /usr/bin/python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, \
          'skills/kicad-pcb/scripts'); from rules_audit import parse_amps; \
          print([parse_amps(s) for s in ('7 A worst case', '6 A / 5 A', \
          '~1.5A pulsed')])"
        # 2026-08-02 -> [(7.0, 'number'), (6.0, 'number'), (1.5, 'number')]

    MEASURED COST OF LEAVING IT: an agent planning the R-POUR repair read this
    paragraph, concluded the prose `current:` field "is not machine-readable",
    and built a contract obligation on that premise. One command refutes it. A
    stale negative claim in a gate's own docstring is not documentation debt —
    it is an instrument reporting a defect that no longer exists, and it
    propagates into whatever reads it.
  * `bom_source_check.row_kind()` classifies by the whole leading-alpha run, so
    `RS1/RS2` (the 10 mOhm shunts setting BOTH buck current limits) and `CE1`
    (the only electrolytic, which shipped REVERSED in v1.0/v1.1) exit leg C
    while the tool prints PASS.
  * `labeled_resistance("10mOhm")` returns 1.0e7 — the multiplier is uppercased
    before lookup, so milli decodes as mega.

None of those is a bad line of code. They are one SHAPE: a checker permitted to
report success over input it did not understand.

THE THREE OBLIGATIONS. A script that prints a verdict must:

  G-INPUT   name the artifact it graded, so a reader can tell whether it read
            the SHIPPED bytes or a reconstruction (canon M6). policy_audit ran
            against a `06_build` shadow tree and reported 79 warnings where the
            sealed archive has 102; bom_source_check graded a filename that does
            not exist in the release.
  G-COVER   emit `N graded / M total`. A verdict with no denominator hides its
            own blind spot, and every instance above is invisible without one.
  G-RED     have a fixture in tests/ that makes it FAIL. A gate that has never
            been observed to fail is a claim, not a control.

THIS SCRIPT IS ITSELF A GATE AND MUST OBEY ITS OWN CONTRACT. It reports its
coverage, it names its input, and t1_gate_contract.py holds its known-bads. Its
acceptance test is adversarial: on first run against this repo it MUST flag a
large number of scripts. A gate-on-gates that comes back clean on a codebase
independently measured as riddled is decoration, and should be deleted rather
than trusted.

VACUITY: (canon G-VACUOUS, applied to G-VACUOUS. Fixtured by
`t1_gate_contract.py` `t_vacuity_G_VACUOUS_passes_a_repo_where_no_gate_declares
_anything`.)

G-VACUOUS grades "every gate's blind spot is known". It PASSES on a repo where
**no gate declares anything**, because it treats an absent declaration as OWED
rather than as a violation. That is not a slip — a day-one mandate over 31 gates
lands as 31 red rows and is disabled within the week, which is the failure mode
this whole family exists to avoid. But it means the exit code is compatible with
the graded fact being false for the entire fleet.

HOW THE CIRCLE IS BROKEN. A coverage gate on partial adoption cannot be made
non-vacuous on the empty case; asking it to police itself only regresses. What it
CAN be made is BOUNDED, ENUMERATED and MONOTONE, and all three are outside its own
judgement:

  * BOUNDED — the blind spot is exactly the set in `owed`, and nothing else. Any
    gate that DOES declare is fully graded, in both directions.
  * ENUMERATED — every owed gate is printed BY NAME on every run. The vacuity is
    therefore never silent, which is what separates it from all six instances in
    the G-VACUOUS block below: each of those passed with nothing said.
  * MONOTONE — `VACUITY_FLOOR` is a committed integer, and a drop below it is a
    hard FAIL. `t_vacuity_floor_is_pinned_to_the_measured_count` additionally
    pins the floor to what the tree actually achieves, so the floor cannot be
    lowered to buy a green run and cannot silently lag adoption either.

The floor is data a human must edit, in a file a reviewer reads, checked by a test
that measures the tree. That is the break: G-VACUOUS does not certify its own
adoption — the committed number and the test do, and neither is reachable from
inside the audit.

# ADR-0007. A rule file can contradict ITSELF, and then no board can satisfy it.
# fab_tiers.yaml declared min_silk_text_height 0.45 AND min_silk_stroke 0.15 on
# every tier, while KiCad clamps a text stroke to <= 0.25 x height: 0.45 mm text
# can reach at most 0.1125 mm of stroke, so the two floors cannot both be met.
# smc0985-cooksense then shipped six SAFETY designators below the stroke floor —
# J_ESTOP, J_DOOR, J_MODE among them — and the waiver written the same day
# called 0.13 acceptable. Nothing could have passed; nothing said so.
#
# WIDENED 2026-07-29 (same day, second lesson). The first version modelled ONLY
# that upper clamp, so it could prove a published stroke UNREACHABLE but was
# blind to the other direction — and the corollary written beside it in
# fab_tiers.yaml ("to reach the published 0.15 stroke, text must be >= 0.60mm")
# was WRONG for exactly that reason: the generator's LOWER floor is
# max(min_silk_stroke, 0.13, 0.16 x height), so 0.60 / 0.70 / 0.80 all emit
# 0.13 and the true threshold is 0.9375. Two boards (pluto-rx2-8way,
# pluto-cal-switch) each discovered that by measuring the generator after
# following the sentence. A gate that catches only the direction its author got
# right is worthless (canon M-WIDTH), so the rule is now written at the width of
# its class: a tier's published stroke floor must EQUAL what the generator will
# actually emit at that tier's own height floor, in BOTH directions, and the
# tier's declared threshold height for the fab's published stroke must be the
# FIRST height at which the generator reaches it.
#
# THE FORMULA IS NOT COPIED HERE. `load_stroke_model` lifts `silk_stroke` and
# its constants out of generate_board_generic.py's AST and calls them: a checker
# that carries its own copy of the formula it grades is canon M1 failing in the
# other direction — it agrees with a stale copy.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- G-VACUOUS
# THE QUESTION G-RED DOES NOT ASK. G-RED asks "can this gate fail at all?" and
# 31/31 gates answer yes. That is the weak form. The strong form is: CAN IT FAIL
# ON THE CASE IT EXISTS FOR? Six gates measured GREEN on 2026-07-28/29 while the
# fact each grades was FALSE, every one of them internally honest:
#
#   * R-LEN (policy_audit.py:1078) is `re.search(r"length|spread", audit_src)`.
#     smc0985-cooksense gets PASS on ZERO code matches — its only two hits are
#     the words "slot-lengthened" and "lengthens" in COMMENTS about high-voltage
#     creepage. Measured: 3 of 6 boards PASS, 1 of the 3 on comments alone; and
#     pluto-cal-switch, which carries an ADR titled "length match is a published
#     artifact", grades N-A "no timing-critical nets declared".
#   * cooksense's `keypad_isolation_6mm` .kicad_dru rule conditions on
#     `B.NetName != ''`, so UNNETTED copper is exempt BY CONSTRUCTION. Measured:
#     the nearest unnetted copper to a KEYPAD_ISO net is 1.0672 mm from a
#     6.000 mm constraint — a 5.6x violation, on 106 pairs, and the nearest item
#     is J_KEY_MATRIX.MP, the connector shell tab the rule was written for.
#     "0 DRC violations" was never evidence about it.
#   * twin_overlay A-RENDER grades only the parts whose body survives a 2 px
#     erosion at jlc_twin's hard-coded 1600x1000 render. On the 188.1 mm
#     cooksense board that is 8.34 px/mm and 53 of 210 parts are graded.
#   * waiver_provenance W-COPY/W-FOREIGN compare waiver PROSE to other prose and
#     never re-derive a number. A waiver reading "C_SW1 pad 1 -> U_SW pin 8 =
#     2.62 mm, inside the 3 mm" measures 3.085 mm centre-to-centre — OVER the
#     threshold it claimed to be inside — and passed for a full revision cycle.
#   * power_topology E-OFF returns N-A when it finds no source_type, no battery
#     net and no battery-ish ADR, so a real battery board that declares nothing
#     exits 0.
#   * part_facts_check P-FACT now FAILS a zero denominator, but two paths still
#     print `P-FACT OK - 0/0` and exit 0.
#
# So a gate must declare the input class on which it PASSES while the graded
# fact is FALSE. THE DECLARATION IS A FIXTURE, NOT PROSE. A declared blind spot
# with no fixture is strictly worse than an undeclared one: it reads as diligence
# and grades nothing, which is the `keep_short` failure (39 of 181 budgets
# addressed to net names no board has) one level up. So the binding is
# bidirectional and both halves are machine-graded:
#
#   the gate's module DOCSTRING carries a `VACUITY:` block   <->   tests/ carries
#   @test(..., kind="vacuity", gate="<basename>.py") that CONSTRUCTS that input
#   and asserts the gate PASSES on it.
#
# A fixture asserting `must_fail` is a FALSE declaration and fails statically:
# it proves the gate BITES where the docstring claims it is blind. Prose with no
# fixture fails. A fixture with no prose fails (a reader of the gate must see
# it). A fixture naming a gate not in the inventory fails (a rename silently
# un-declares otherwise).
#
# WHY THE DOCSTRING AND NOT A REGISTRY. A registry is a second home and drifts;
# the R-LEN defect above is precisely a check satisfied by text. So the
# declaration is read from `ast.get_docstring` ONLY — a `VACUITY:` in a comment,
# in a nested function's docstring, or in a code string does NOT satisfy it, and
# `t_vacuity_prose_outside_the_module_docstring_is_not_a_declaration` pins that.
# The docstring alone is still prose; what makes it a check is that it is
# INERT WITHOUT the fixture, and the fixture is inert without it.
VACUITY_RE = re.compile(r"^[ \t]*VACUITY:", re.M)

#: THE RATCHET. 31 gates are in the inventory and a day-one fleet mandate would
#: land as 31 red rows and be disabled by the end of the week (the honest
#: precedent: G-RED's own adversarial acceptance floor had to be DELETED once
#: the backlog closed, not lowered). So coverage is REPORTED for all 31 and
#: OWED gates are named, while only three things FAIL: a false declaration, a
#: declaration without a fixture, and a drop below this floor. Raise it as gates
#: adopt; `t_vacuity_floor_is_pinned_to_the_measured_count` refuses a lowering.
#: 6 since 2026-07-29: `schema_reader_audit.py` (canon G-ORPHAN) landed with a
#: declared and fixtured blind spot — it PASSES a family whose every key is
#: declared `OWED`. Raised in the SAME commit that added the declaration, which
#: is the ratchet working rather than a number chasing the tree.
#: 8 since 2026-07-30: `build_provenance.py` (canon M-FRESH) declared F-RENDER's
#: blind spot when the finding landed — the HUMAN schematic has no second copy
#: to hash against, so its build-time freshness is a TIME ORDERING and a `touch`
#: defeats it, where F-PATH's cross-file sha256 cannot be defeated at all. The
#: interesting part is that ONE GATE now carries both: the same file has an
#: undefeatable assertion and a forgeable one, and only saying so out loud keeps
#: a reader from generalising the strong one to the weak one.
#: 10 since 2026-07-31: `trace_audit.py` (canon GG-SHADOW/GG-RESOLVE) declares
#: the blind spot that STOPPED its own layer — it exits 0 over a battery that
#: saw only a gate's own PRE-EXISTING exhaust, because neither the write-set (a
#: METHOD test) nor the pre-run snapshot (an EXISTENCE test) is an IDENTITY
#: test. The declaration landed WITH its fixture, which reproduces the vacuous
#: pass on every run instead of asserting it in prose. Raised in the same commit
#: that earns it, never ahead of one.
#: 16 since 2026-08-15: the progressive-disclosure router and authority audit
#: landed with declarations and executable fixtures. The router composes a
#: profile without proving a board exists; the authority audit proves lexical
#: reachability without understanding whether prose reversed a policy.
