"""schema_reader_audit — G-ORPHAN: every schema key a hand-authored source file

WHY THIS EXISTS. A DECLARED FIELD THAT NOTHING READS IS WORSE THAN AN ABSENT
ONE, because it reads as covered. `02_parts/*/part.yaml` may declare
`layout.adjacency:` — a refdes-pair proximity budget — and until 2026-07-29
`policy_audit.py`'s P-ADJ read `keep_short` entries ONLY. So pluto-rx2-8way's
requirement that `U_ESD` sit within ~2.0 mm of `J_USB`, where 6 nH per 10 mm of
loop turns a 17 V clamp into a 305 V spike, was graded by NO GATE AT ALL while
appearing in source as if it were live; a human hand-measured it. Same shape,
same week: `length_match:` did not exist as a schema until the day R-LEN landed,
on two boards whose release artifact IS a length delta; `pins.<N>.tie` — a
net-shaped assertion in 43 dossiers — is read by nothing, and that is the exact
field class the `GND_ISO` ghost that reached shipped silk lived in.

E-NETREF (`net_reference_audit.py`) solved the NARROW version of this: it
enumerated its twelve reference kinds BY READING THE CONSUMERS, and prints each
one with the consumer's name (`--kinds`). Its subject is net-shaped VALUES. This
gate is the same method widened from values to KEYS (canon M-WIDTH): the class
is "a schema key with no reader", and net names are one member of it.

WHERE THE BINDING LIVES, AND WHY IT CANNOT DRIFT.

Not here. A `KEYS = {...}` table in this file would be a REGISTRY — a second
home for the schema, which is precisely the failure the escape-block drift
(2026-07-21) and the cooksense MANIFEST-vs-`assembly.yaml` contradiction were
both instances of. So the binding lives in the ONE artifact that already owns
each schema: the governing contract TEMPLATE under
`skills/pcb-design/templates/contracts/`, which `CLAUDE.md` already makes
mandatory to update in the same change as a schema change, and which
`t1_contracts.py t_skill_contract_sync` already cross-checks. This gate adds no
new home; it makes the existing one EXECUTABLE (ADR-0007).

A declaration is a table under a heading naming the file family it governs:

    ### keys: 03_src/rules/power_tree.yaml

    | key | reader | why |
    |---|---|---|
    | `rails[].vin_min` | `power_topology.py` | E-TOPO envelope |
    | `rails[].name` | ADVISORY | a LABEL: no gate resolves it as a net |
    | `rails[].note` | OWED | free prose; no gate reads it yet |

and the DRIFT is caught in all three directions, which is what makes this
different from a registry:

  * a key appears in real source with NO row  -> ORPHAN, and the gate FAILS.
    Adding a field to a board without saying who reads it is the defect.
  * a row names a reader that does not read it -> UNREAD, and the gate FAILS.
    This is the `layout.adjacency` case and the retired R-LEN predicate's case.
  * a row names a reader that no longer exists, or a file this gate cannot
    parse -> UNPROVABLE, and the gate FAILS. Never a skip (canon M-COVER).

Nothing is restated: the contract holds a CLAIM, and the claim's truth is read
out of the consumer's AST on every run.

WHAT "PROVABLY READS IT" CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. THIS IS THE HARD PART.

R-LEN's whole defect was crediting a WORD's presence: `re.search(r"length|
spread", src)` passed smc0985-cooksense on two comments about a creepage slot
being lengthened. A grep is therefore refused outright. What this gate does
instead, per named consumer:

  PROVES  the key's own name appears as a STRING CONSTANT IN A READ POSITION in
          the consumer's parsed AST — a subscript slice (`d["max_span_mm"]`), a
          `.get`/`.pop`/`.setdefault` first argument, an `==`/`in` comparand, or
          an element of a literal list/tuple/set that code iterates. And it
          proves the same for EVERY literal segment of the key's path, so
          `layout.keep_short[].max_span_mm` requires `layout`, `keep_short` AND
          `max_span_mm` to each be read in the same file. Line numbers are
          printed for each, so a reviewer can check the claim in one jump.

  CANNOT PROVE  (a) that the read is off THIS structure. `"name"` subscripted
          anywhere in `power_topology.py` satisfies `rails[].name`; a same-named
          key on an unrelated dict would too. The path-segment requirement
          raises the bar but does not close this, and it is why the report
          prints the line numbers rather than a bare PASS.
          (b) that the value REACHES A VERDICT. A key read and discarded counts
          as read. That is E-INV's and G-VACUOUS's job, not this gate's.
          (c) a DYNAMICALLY built key (`d[f"{axis}_mm"]`) or one consumed by a
          schema-driven `for k, v in d.items()` loop. Those are invisible here
          and must be declared with an explicit reader that does name the key,
          or as ADVISORY/OWED with a reason.
          (d) anything in a non-Python consumer. A named reader that will not
          `ast.parse` is UNPROVABLE and FAILS, rather than being waved through.

  REFUSES  a MENTION: an exact-match constant that is NOT in a read position —
          a docstring, a message string, a dict literal key. `ast.get_docstring`
          text and `ast.Dict` keys are classified MENTION on purpose, and a
          row whose only evidence is a mention FAILS with that word in the
          finding, because "the gate talks about the key" is the R-LEN error.

ADVISORY IS A DECLARED STATE WITH A REASON, NEVER A SILENT EXEMPTION.

Some keys are legitimately read by nobody, and failing them produces a gate that
gets waived into uselessness. E-NETREF found exactly ONE such kind among twelve;
this gate does not assume the count and asks each contract to name its own. An
`ADVISORY` row REQUIRES a non-empty `why`, and the reasons the fleet actually
has are three distinct mechanisms, not one:

  1. A LABEL THE GRADER NEVER RESOLVES. `power_tree.yaml rails[].name` — the
     E-NETREF precedent. `power_topology.py` grades the rail's NUMBERS and
     never looks the name up, so `name: USB-A` is correct documentation.
  2. INTENT ADDRESSED TO A HUMAN REVIEWER, WHOSE PRESENCE IS ITSELF GRADED.
     `nets.yaml classes.<C>.intent` / `verify`, `layout.notes`, every `why:`.
     No gate resolves the prose; something else (`policy_audit`, `M-WAIV`,
     `contracts_audit`) grades that it EXISTS and is non-empty. Advisory here
     means "the TEXT is not machine-graded", not "the field is unchecked".
  3. A PROVENANCE FACT SPENT OUTSIDE THIS PIPELINE. `datasheet.note`,
     `layout.source`, `land_pattern.*` — read by a person at part-selection
     time. Declaring these OWED would be dishonest: nobody intends a gate.

OWED is the RATCHET, and it is a different claim from ADVISORY: it means a gate
is INTENDED and absent. The two are counted separately for exactly that reason —
`--families` prints both, and a family's OWED count is the debt.

THE RATCHET, AND WHY DAY ONE IS NOT FULL COMPLIANCE.

A gate that reds every contract on day one gets disabled; G-VACUOUS landed 5 of
32 declared with 27 named OWED and its floor pinned so it can only rise, and
this follows it. Two levels:

  * WITHIN a governed family the gate is FULLY hard — every observed key is
    PROVEN, ADVISORY, OWED or ORPHAN, and an ORPHAN fails. There is no partial
    credit inside a family.
  * A file family with NO `### keys:` block anywhere is UNGOVERNED: reported BY
    NAME on every run, and it does not fail. That is the ratchet's only slack,
    it is enumerated rather than silent, and `tests/t1_schema_reader.py`
    `t_governed_family_floor_is_pinned` pins the governed-family count and the
    PROVEN-key count to what the tree achieves, so neither can be lowered to
    buy a green run nor silently lag adoption.

MEASURED ON LANDING (2026-07-29, `--root .` over 6 projects, 176 hand-authored
source files; reproduced every run by `t_real_fleet_denominator`):

  11 governed families, 4 UNGOVERNED and named (`assembly.yaml`, `mates.yaml`,
  `rf.yaml`, `twin_adjudications.yaml`). 420 declared rows include **345
  PROVEN** readers, with 0 ORPHAN. Those rows cover more than 1205 distinct
  schema keys** the fleet's source actually declares, 881 of them under 39 `*`
  SUBTREE claims (`limits.*`, `land_pattern.*`, `stitch.<pass>.*`), which is
  why both numbers are printed: 293/293 alone would overstate it.

FOUR ORPHANS THE FIRST RUN FOUND, each a field that read as covered:

  1. `policy_waivers.yaml [].refs` — **A WAIVER IS APPLIED BY `id` ALONE.**
     `policy_audit.py` builds `waived_ids` from `w["id"]` and never reads
     `refs:`; `waiver_provenance.py` reads `why`/`derived_from` only. So a
     waiver written for `refs: [J1]` silences that check for EVERY ref on the
     board, and `policy_audit.py`'s own docstring documents the `{id, refs,
     why}` shape — a MENTION, the exact R-LEN shape.
  2. `power_tree.yaml linear_rails[]` — five smc0985-cooksense rails with a
     full `vin_min`/`vin_max`/`vout_min`/`vout_max`/`iout_max_A` envelope, and
     `power_topology.py` names `linear_rails` only in a docstring paragraph
     explaining that it ignores it. "Vout IS Vin minus an Rds(on)/ESR drop" is
     checkable arithmetic that nothing checks, and the currents are absent from
     the trunk-current sum too.
  3. `nets.yaml classes.<C>.intent` / `routing` / `verify` — REQUIRED per class
     by the 03_src/rules contract since that folder was created, filled in on
     all 38 fleet classes, read by NOTHING — not even their presence. The
     `current:` field in the same required list got A-AMP and a "silence is not
     a declaration" rule; its three neighbours got neither.
  4. `length_match.<G>.phase` — originally declared "OPTIONAL reporting aid,
     never a gate" while `copper_length_audit.py` printed a different global
     constant. Closed 2026-08-01: the audit consumes the group tuple and, when
     `solver_evidence` is named, cross-checks delay, epsilon, impedance,
     frequency, stackup and cross-section against that artifact.

Plus 21 OWED rows in `02_parts/*/part.yaml`, the file this rule was written
for — among them `pins.<N>.tie` (84 pins, 43 dossiers), `datasheet.sha256` /
`revision` (an M-IMPORT provenance grade nothing recomputes), `sourcing.
do_not_use` (a banned LCSC code no gate refuses) and `escape.checked`.

INDEPENDENCE (canon M1). The claim side is markdown prose in contracts.md; the
proof side is the consumer's Python AST; the denominator side is the boards' own
YAML. Three artifacts, three parsers, no shared method — and in particular this
gate never imports or executes a consumer, so a consumer cannot influence its
own grade.

`pins.<N>.tie` IS NOT CLOSED HERE, DELIBERATELY, AND THE PATCH IS WRITTEN.
`tie:` is a NET NAME (`GND`, `AGND`, `DGND`, `none`) asserting which net a pin
must land on — a reference, which is E-NETREF's subject, not this gate's. It is
declared OWED in the 02_parts contract, and this is the patch its owner should
apply to `net_reference_audit.py` rather than have a second gate resolve nets:

    KINDS["K13"] = ("02_parts/*/part.yaml", "pins.<N>.tie",
                    "electrical_invariants.py pin_on_net (OWED — see below)",
                    True)
    # in collect_parts(), beside the keep_short loop:
    for pin, spec in (d.get("pins") or {}).items():
        if isinstance(spec, dict) and _str(spec.get("tie")) \
                and spec["tie"] not in ("none", "NC", "nc"):
            refs.append(Ref("K13", f"02_parts/{py.parent.name}/part.yaml "
                                   f"pins.{pin}.tie", spec["tie"]))

The `none`/`NC` exclusion is load-bearing: `XU316-1024-TQ128-I24` declares
`tie: none` on four IO-voltage straps that are DELIBERATELY FLOATING, and
failing those would be the false lead that gets K13 waived. Once K13 lands,
the 02_parts row for `pins.<N>.tie` becomes `net_reference_audit.py` and this
gate will hold it there.

NOT WIRED INTO `policy_audit.py`, DELIBERATELY, AND THAT IS A GAP.
This gate lands with its tests, its canon row and its contract sections but is
not called by the policy audit, so no board's `policy_audit.md` reports G-ORPHAN
yet. Two reasons, neither of them doubt. (a) Its subject is the SKILL, not a
board: it grades contract templates against the fleet, so a per-board row would
report the same verdict on every board — the right shape is one repo-level row,
which is `gate_contract_audit.py`'s territory, not `policy_audit.py`'s. (b) At
landing time two boards were mid-rebuild and mid-route, and `policy_audit.py`
was under another agent's edit. **The follow-up is owed:** call it from
`gate_contract_audit.py` beside G-SELFCON (`--root REPO`, exit 0 = PASS, 2 =
UNGRADED not N-A) once that file is quiet. Until then run it by hand; the canon
row, this file and the `### keys:` tables are the authority.

VACUITY: (canon G-VACUOUS. Fixtured by `tests/t1_schema_reader.py`
`t_vacuity_a_family_declared_entirely_OWED_passes`.)

G-ORPHAN PASSES a governed family in which EVERY key is declared `OWED` — a
contract that has named its whole schema and bound none of it to a reader.
The graded fact ("every declared key names a gate that reads it") is then FALSE
for every key in that family, and the exit code is 0. That is the ratchet,
chosen over a day-one wall of red that gets the gate turned off; but it means a
green G-ORPHAN is NOT by itself evidence that any key is bound.

Three things bound it, none of them reachable from inside this audit:
BOUNDED — the slack is exactly the `OWED` set and the ungoverned-family set,
nothing else; every other key is graded in both directions. ENUMERATED — both
sets are printed by name on every run, so the vacuity is never silent, which is
what separates it from the six G-VACUOUS instances of 2026-07-28/29 (each of
those passed with nothing said). MONOTONE — `GOVERNED_FLOOR` and `PROVEN_FLOOR`
are committed integers a reviewer reads, a drop below either is a hard FAIL, and
a test pins them to what the tree measures so they cannot lag adoption either.

Exit 0 when every observed key is PROVEN, ADVISORY or OWED; 1 on any ORPHAN,
UNREAD or UNPROVABLE row, or if either floor is breached; 2 when the audit
itself could not run (unparseable contract, unparseable source, no families
declared, nothing observed) — never a green zero.
