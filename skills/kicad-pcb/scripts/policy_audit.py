OWED, AND READ THIS BEFORE STARTING IT: THE FLAT `03_src/rules/<name>` PATHS
BELOW ARE WRONG ON AN ADR-0007 MULTI-BOARD PROJECT. On the two-board exemplar
they resolve to five SYMLINKS into `03_src/<boardA>/rules/` while a second, REAL
288-line set at `03_src/<boardB>/rules/` is graded by nothing — so this gate
grades ONE board and reports on the PROJECT, and `03_src/floorplan.yaml` and
`03_src/route.yaml` do not exist at all at the flat path while the per-board
copies do. Named by canon GG-SHADOW / GG-RESOLVE; `trace_audit.py --subject
projects/<name>` reproduces it in one command.

**THE REMEDY IS NATURALLY A DISPATCHER — ONE WORKER PER BOARD — AND UNTIL
2026-07-31 THAT SHAPE WOULD HAVE TURNED GG-SHADOW RED ON THE FIXED PROJECT.**
`gg_shadow` rebuilt its "was this opened" set from ONE TRACE, and a tracer writes
one trace per PROCESS, so the fix for the defect GG-SHADOW found would have made
GG-SHADOW fire. MEASURED then: a dispatcher and its in-process twin with the
identical read-set gave RAW EXIT 1 (2 false findings) and RAW EXIT 0.
`trace_audit.opened_union()` now takes the union across every trace and
`tests/fixtures/gg_dispatch/` keeps it that way — so the dispatcher shape is
SAFE, but do not reintroduce a per-trace read-set while doing this work, and if
GG-SHADOW fires on a correctly split project, suspect that first.

# ------------------------------------------- P-PREC: the precedent ratchet
# MEASURED read-only over `projects/*/02_parts/*/part.yaml` on 2026-07-30 at
# main tip, with P-LAYOUT's own in-scope rule (npins > 2, or `type:` matching
# LAYOUT_SCOPE) so the two gates share ONE denominator and cannot disagree
# about which parts are in scope.
#
# MONOTONE IN THE DIRECTION THAT MATTERS, following `adr_bound_provenance`'s
# CITED_FLOOR and `gate_contract_audit`'s VACUITY_FLOOR:
#   GRADED may only RISE (fleet-wide), OWED may only FALL (PER BOARD).
# Edit either only in the commit that earns it, and say which run produced the
# number. Pinned to the measured tree by `tests/t1_layout_precedent.py`
# `t_the_precedent_ratchet_is_pinned_to_the_fleet` — which sweeps the fleet
# with its OWN reader (canon M1) rather than running this gate, so the floor
# can neither be lowered to buy a green run nor silently lag adoption.
#
# THE TWO HALVES ARE SCOPED DIFFERENTLY, AND THAT ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE POINT.
#
# A ratchet is only a ratchet if the work it demands is work someone can DO.
# GRADED-may-only-RISE is fleet-wide and safe there: commissioning a board can
# only ADD parts, so the count never falls, and when a new board arrives
# carrying a graded dossier the obligation is to raise one number in the same
# commit — satisfiable.
#
# OWED WAS FLEET-WIDE TOO, AND THAT WAS A DEFECT, not a strict setting.
# `owed <= 89` is an absolute count of un-graded in-scope parts across every
# board. Commissioning ANY board with one un-graded in-scope part breaches it
# on day one, and NO amount of work on the existing boards can prevent that.
# It breached within hours of landing: pluto-rx2-8way-v2 arrived with 3 in-scope
# parts and the fleet went 89 -> 91 while genuinely IMPROVING (89/89 = 1.000 of
# scope owed, then 91/92 = 0.989). A bound that a correct action breaks is not
# a ratchet; it is a tax on commissioning, and the only way to pay it is to
# re-baseline — which records nothing and re-breaks on the next board.
#
# A FRACTION-OF-SCOPE CEILING DOES NOT FIX IT EITHER, which is worth writing
# down because it is the obvious next idea. While the fleet fraction is below
# 1.000, a new all-ungraded board pushes it back UP toward 1.000 and breaches
# again. Any FLEET AGGREGATE has this shape.
#
# So OWED is scoped PER BOARD. A board's own owed count is a thing that board's
# author controls, it can only fall through their work, and a NEW board cannot
# breach another board's bound. A board absent from the map is reported as NOT
# YET RATCHETED in its own P-PREC row — not failed, because a board that has
# never been measured cannot have regressed — and picks up a bound the first
# time someone records one. That declared gap is the honest price of never
# failing a board for existing.

    # routed reference — "Hardware design with RP2040" Figure 6, PDF p9 — READ
    # VISUALLY AT 200 dpi off a raster. Raspberry Pi also publishes, at
    # https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html
    # (fetched 2026-07-30), a **"Minimal Viable Board" reference design in
    # KiCad** and the full Pico / Pico W designs in Cadence Allegro, all under
    # "Raspberry Pi grants permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute the
    # following designs for any purpose, with or without fee" — i.e. an EDITABLE
    # tier-2 artifact you can open and MEASURE, free, for the exact part. The
    # dossier reached tier 1 and said so honestly: it already carries
    # "OWED: minimal-design-example and VGA-demo KiCad design files ... Not
    # fetched; Figure 6 is a raster." THAT SENTENCE IS THE JUDGEMENT THIS GATE
    # WANTS, and it was invisible to every gate in the repo.
    #
    # WHAT IS GRADED, AND WHY IT IS NOT "REACH TIER 2 OR FAIL". This gate cannot
    # know whether a stronger artifact EXISTS for an arbitrary part — that is a
    # fact about the web, not about this tree — and a gate that demanded tier 2
    # unconditionally would red all 92 in-scope parts on day one and be switched
    # off within the week (the failure mode named by name in both
    # `gate_contract_audit`'s G-VACUOUS block and `schema_reader_audit`'s
    # ratchet). Reaching tier 2 is also not always RIGHT: the guide is a 19.9 MB
    # fetch and Allegro is not openable here. What IS always right, and what is
    # therefore the graded obligation, is that THE LADDER NAMES ITS CEILING —
    # a record that stops below tier 4 must carry a `reached: false` entry
    # saying what sits above it and why that was not reached. Honesty about the

        #
        # TWO DEFECTS FIXED HERE 2026-07-29, found independently by two board
        # agents from opposite directions, and they are the same defect: the
        # gate reported a verdict it had not earned.
        #
        # (a) IT MEASURED THE WRONG DISTANCE. The span was the MAXIMUM PAD PAIR
        # OVER THE WHOLE NET, which is not what a `keep_short` sentence means.
        # A datasheet decoupling sentence is about a PIN and its NEAREST
        # QUALIFYING PARTNER ("100 nF close to EACH IOVDD pin", "1 uF close to
        # VREG_VOUT"), so the number that grades it is the anchor pin's
        # distance to the nearest pad that serves it. The whole-net maximum has
        # a property that by itself disqualifies it as a placement metric:
        # ADDING A CORRECTLY-PLACED BULK CAPACITOR MAKES THE BUDGET SCORE
        # WORSE, because the new pad extends the net's span. Measured:
        #   * pluto-cal-switch RP2040:3V3 reported 72.96mm against 4mm — 3V3 is
        #     a poured rail crossing the board. The ANCHOR metric on the same
        #     44 budgets is 44/44 PASS, worst 2.60mm (U_MCU.26 -> C_IO3.1).
        #   * pluto-rx2-8way RP2040:DVDD_1V1 reported 13.167mm against 10mm off
        #     a 6-pad net. The anchor metric says 8.79mm (U_MCU.23 ->
        #     C_MCU7.1): inside the budget, and it REPORTS the tight pair
        #     instead of burying it under a board-scale number.
        # It does NOT soften the incident P-ADJ was built for: usb-hub-3s-v2's
        # TPS25740A RSNS still FAILS, 7.34mm (U1.19 -> Q6.5) against 5mm, where
        # the whole-net figure was 10.18mm. And ABM8-272-T3's `GND <= 3mm` on
        # pluto-rx2-8way still FAILS — 3.23mm (Y_XTAL.4 -> C_XTAL1.2) instead
        # of 67.24mm, which was the board's DIAGONAL and not the crystal's
        # anything. A budget nobody can act on is not enforcement.
        # THE ANCHOR IS STATED, ALWAYS (the PASS detail names the graded pair):
        # an unstated anchor is a hidden assumption. `anchor_pins:` lets the
        # author name the pin(s) explicitly when the sentence is about one pair.
        #
        # (b) IT NEVER READ `layout.adjacency` AT ALL. Refdes-pair budgets were
        # in the schema, in the part.yaml files, and graded by NOTHING — while
        # LOOKING covered, which is worse than an absent field. The live
        # example, with its number: USBLC6-2SC6 requires U_ESD within 2.0mm of
        # J_USB because ST DocID11265 sec 2.2 turns 6nH per 10mm into a 17V
        # clamp firing at 305V; pluto-rx2-8way's floorplan sat at ~8mm and no
        # gate objected, so the board's agent had to hand-measure it.
        # An adjacency budget is graded as the COPPER GAP between the two
        # parts' pads on each shared net (pad edge to pad edge = the track
        # length the 6nH/10mm arithmetic applies to), worst shared net wins.
        # POURED nets are excluded from that measurement and said to be: two
        # parts on a plane are joined BY THE PLANE, and a pad-gap does not
        # measure a pour connection (it is R-THERM/stitch work).

    #      the wrong archive, and M-REL demanded SUPERSEDED.md on
    #      cooksense-v1.4 — the LIVE release — which blocked the v1.5 seal.
