"""release_required_check.py — canon A-EVID: is every REQUIRED release artifact
actually THERE?

    release_required_check.py <release-dir> [--contract PATH] [--json OUT]

WHY THIS EXISTS. `contracts_audit.py` iterates FILES THAT EXIST and asks "is
this permitted?" — C-ALLOW, C-COV, C-ISO all loop over the tree. Nothing ever
walked the contract's REQUIRED list and asked "is it here?". So the ALLOWED
direction was enforced and the REQUIRED direction was enforced by nobody, and
three releases were caught by that in a single day (2026-07-26):

  * usb-hub-3s-v3 v1.6 sealed with 13 files in verification/ where its own
    contract names ~34 REQUIRED. policy_audit was FAIL=0 and contracts_audit
    reported 187 files / 0 violations. M-REL only asks whether verification/
    is non-empty. The MANIFEST asserted DRC 0/0/0 and twin 119/119 with no
    machine evidence in the release for either — and, worse, the missing
    `standalone_archive_drc.json` WAS the gate that would have caught v1.6's
    real defect: its fp-lib-table pointed outside the archive, so 12
    footprints failed to load for anyone who extracted source/.
  * smc0985-cooksense reached a seal attempt with ZERO sha256 hashes in its
    MANIFEST, which the contract requires.
  * crow-mic-pod-v2 v1.1 staged with 9 REQUIRED items absent or MIS-NAMED
    (`bare_top.png` for `render_top_bare.png`, and five more). A mis-named
    required artifact is worse than an absent one: it looks present to a
    human and is invisible to every name-based check.

A diff against the PREVIOUS RELEASE is not a substitute and was tried first.
It makes a board's first release vacuous, and it inherits the predecessor's
omissions — crow-mic-pod's `comm -23` against v1.0 came back EMPTY while nine
contract-required items were missing. THE CONTRACT IS THE AUTHORITY.

NEVER SILENTLY SKIP. Every line of the contract tree is classified, and any
line this parser cannot read is reported as UNPARSED and counts as a failure.
A checker that quietly ignores what it does not understand is the defect it
exists to prevent: `bom_source_check` classified refdes by leading-alpha
prefix and silently dropped 12 of 26 passive rows while printing PASS.

TREE_RE = re.compile(r"^(?P<indent>[\s│]*)(?:├──|└──)\s*(?P<item>\S+)\s*(?P<desc>.*)$")

#: a DIRECTORY node carrying contract METAVARIABLE syntax — `<version>-<date>`,
#: `[<board>-]<version>-<date>`. Deliberately a SEPARATE name from
#: PLACEHOLDER_RE below, which rewrites an artifact NAME into a glob: the two
#: questions are different ("is this a real path component?" vs "what filename
#: does this describe?"), and one regex answering both is how a widened
#: contract form would silently change matching behaviour.
METAVAR_DIR_RE = re.compile(r"[<>\[\]]")

#: REQUIRED, but only under a condition the CONTRACT states. These are reported
#: as CONDITIONAL and never as a hard failure — the tool cannot know whether a
#: board is tscircuit-authored or whether a 3D model exists upstream, and
#: guessing would be the same overreach the ALLOWED-only audit made in reverse.

#: an ASCII tree connector — "|--", "+--", "\\--". A contract line shaped like
#: a tree entry but not drawn with box characters is MALFORMED, not prose, and
#: must be reported. Skipping it silently is how my own first implementation
#: reproduced the defect it exists to catch: `|-- verification/` was swallowed
#: as a description line, so verification/ never entered the stack and its
#: children silently inherited the PREVIOUS sibling (3d/, conditional) — a
#: whole required directory vanished from the check while it printed OK.
