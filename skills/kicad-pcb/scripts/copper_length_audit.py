===========================================================================
WHY THIS EXISTS: TWO BOARDS WHOSE ENTIRE PURPOSE IS A LENGTH, AND A GATE THAT
GRADED THE WORD "length"
===========================================================================

`policy_audit.py` has carried an `R-LEN` row since the canon was written. Until
this file landed it was:

    has_len = bool(re.search(r"length|spread", audit_src, re.I))
    rows.append(("R-LEN", "PASS" if has_len else "N-A", ...))

**R-LEN passed if the word "length" or "spread" appeared anywhere in the
project's `03_src/audit_board.py`.** A COMMENT satisfied it. MEASURED over the
fleet on 2026-07-29, before this gate existed:

| board | pre-fix R-LEN | what the words actually were |
|---|---|---|
| smc0985-cooksense | **PASS** | two COMMENTS about a creepage slot being "lengthened" and an outline notch that "lengthens" a path. Nothing to do with any net. |
| pluto-rx2-8way | **PASS** | comments about equal-length radials, plus an I3 check that measures pad-centre RADIUS — placement, not copper — and whose own text says `STAGE-6 OBLIGATION: equalise ROUTED length to +/-0.10mm`. Nothing enforces that obligation. |
| crow-recorder-central-v2 | **PASS** | the only HONEST pass in the fleet: it really does sum `t.GetLength()` over the USB pair and floor the spread at 1 mm. |
| **pluto-cal-switch** | **N-A** — *"no timing-critical nets declared"* | the board that exists to PUBLISH a length delta had NO length gate at all, and the audit said so in words that read like an absence of requirement. |
| crow-mic-pod-v2, usb-hub-3s-v3 | N-A | correct — neither declares a matched path. |

So 3 of 6 boards passed a length gate on prose, 1 of 6 actually measured
copper, and the ONE board whose release artifact IS a length was graded N-A.
That is canon M-COVER's exact failure shape: a gate reporting success over
input it never looked at. This file is also canon M8 (two-strike promotion):
crow-recorder-central-v2's bespoke USB-pair length check is the first strike
and the pluto pair is the second, so the check becomes shared backend.

THE DEFECT UNDERNEATH IT — WHY PLACEMENT IS NOT PHASE.
`pluto-cal-switch/03_src/audit_board.py` publishes, at PASS:

    A-SYM  11 arm pairs are an exact +14.5 mm translation at identical
           rotation (worst error 0.0 um) — the D4 delta is a placement
           property, not a routing outcome

A-SYM compares footprint `GetPosition()` / `GetOrientationDegrees()`; its
sibling A-SEG sums PAD-TO-PAD straight-line distance. Both are placement
metrics carrying electrical names. The published D4 delta is a PHASE
difference between two RF paths, and **phase is a property of copper.** Two
mirror-perfect placements joined by two differently-meandered traces have
identical A-SYM and different phase; the router that lays that copper is, by
this repo's own contract, STOCHASTIC. So both pluto boards could pass every
gate they own and be wrong in the exact quantity they exist to produce — the
D1 reverse-polarity shape, every artifact self-consistent, the intent
unexpressed.

THE ARITHMETIC, RE-DERIVED HERE FROM THE STACKUP RATHER THAN INHERITED.
Ordered stackup `JLC04161H-7628`, top prepreg h = 0.2104 mm, Dk 4.4, RF trace
w = 0.36 mm (pluto-rx2-8way `nets.yaml`; cal-switch uses 0.35 mm). Hammerstad
microstrip effective permittivity, no thickness correction:

    eps_eff = (er+1)/2 + (er-1)/2 / sqrt(1 + 10h/w)
            = 2.70 + 1.70 / sqrt(1 + 5.844)  = 2.70 + 0.650 = 3.350

    t_pd    = sqrt(eps_eff)/c = 1.8303 / 299.792 mm/ns = 6.105 ps/mm
    lambda_g(6 GHz) = 299.792 / (6 * 1.8303) = 27.29 mm
    phase   = 360 * f * t_pd = 360 * 6e9 * 6.105e-12 = 13.19 deg/mm

ASSUMPTIONS STATED: er = 4.4 as declared in the board's own `nets.yaml` (the
laminate's own datasheet window is 4.2-4.6, which moves t_pd by +-1.7%); no
etch-thickness correction; no dispersion. My 6.105 ps/mm reproduces
pluto-rx2-8way ADR-0003's 6.09 and pluto-cal-switch ADR-0011's 6.0 to within
2%, so the three derivations corroborate each other (canon M1). **13.2 deg per
millimetre at 6 GHz** — the commissioning estimate of 12.7 deg/mm was, if
anything, an under-statement. One millimetre of unmatched copper is the same
order as an entire AoA phase budget.

===========================================================================
WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT (state it or it is a lie)
===========================================================================

MEASURED, per net, from the shipped `.kicad_pcb` bytes:
  * `(segment ...)` centreline length, Euclidean, per copper layer.
  * `(arc ...)` centreline length as r*theta from its start/mid/end triple.
  * `(via ...)` count, layer span, and its BARREL Z-LENGTH — but only when the
    stackup is DECLARED (see below). A via is real copper on a phase path.
  * A plated through-hole PAD barrel when track endpoints on that pad's exact
    board coordinate use two copper layers.  This is the same measurable
    layer-transition copper as a via; omitting it makes a connector-pad
    crossover look disconnected and charges only the other conductor's via.

NOT MEASURED, each with its reason, because an unmeasurable term is UNREACHED
and never silently a pass (canon M-COVER):

  1. **PAD-ENTRY COPPER.** The land itself is copper, and a track ends where
     the router chose, not at the pad centre. This gate measures TRACKS AND
     VIAS ONLY, so every absolute figure is reported as a **LOWER BOUND**
     (`>=`) and every derived picosecond with it. The DELTA is a different
     matter: for a matched group whose members are congruent — identical
     footprints at identical rotation, which is exactly what `A-SYM` on
     pluto-cal-switch and ADR-0006(d) on pluto-rx2-8way already require — the
     pad term is IDENTICAL on both members and CANCELS. A group therefore
     declares `congruent_pads: true` to claim that cancellation; without it
     the SPREAD is reported and UNREACHED rather than graded, because a
     comparison of two lower bounds with different unmeasured offsets is not
     a measurement.
  2. **VIA BARREL Z-LENGTH WITHOUT A DECLARED STACKUP.** The generated boards
     in this fleet carry NO `(stackup ...)` block, and `(general (thickness))`
     alone cannot give it: assuming equal dielectric spacing on
     `JLC04161H-7628` (0.2104 / 0.9792 / 0.2104 mm) would put an F->In1 hop at
     0.533 mm instead of 0.210 mm — 2.5x wrong, ~0.3 mm of phantom copper,
     4 deg at 6 GHz. So z-length is derived ONLY from a declared
     `stackup_mm:`; otherwise the member's total is UNREACHED and the via
     count is printed. For the pluto arms this never arises: both ADRs forbid
     vias outright, and `no_vias: true` turns that intent into a FAIL.
  3. **ZONES AND POURS.** A net that reaches a filled polygon has no path
     length — the current spreads. Any zone on a member net makes the member
     UNREACHED. A phase net must never be poured, so this is a real finding.

THE TREE PROBLEM — A NET IS NOT A PATH.
Copper on a net is a graph, and "the length of net X" is ambiguous the moment
it branches (a T to a stub, a shunt cap, a fence tap). This gate builds the
per-net copper graph over layer-aware endpoints (segment ends, arc ends, and
via barrels joining the same x,y on two layers) and reports:

    total_mm     all copper on the net, stubs included. Always defined.
    n_comp       connected components. >1 means the net is not one run.
    n_branch     vertices of degree >= 3.
    n_end        vertices of degree 1 (the terminals, i.e. pad landings).
    path_mm      the longest simple path (graph diameter by edge weight).

**`total_mm` is copper inventory, not propagation length.** It remains the
legacy graded quantity only for declarations without explicit `paths:` and
only after a chain earns the older zero-branch/zero-cycle predicate.  New
tree, reversible-connector and series-component contracts declare exact
REF.PAD-to-REF.PAD paths.  Those paths are joined through same-net pad copper,
graded individually, and every unused physical edge is reported as
`off_path_mm` and FAILS.  A compensating stub can therefore never improve a
path skew verdict.  `topology: tree` alone is no longer sufficient evidence
for a new design; the leaves must be enumerated by `paths:`.

`n_comp > 1` is reported and is deliberately NOT a failure: two tracks landing
on ONE pad at different points are joined by the LAND, which a pads-free
reader cannot see, so an ordinary routed net reads as several components.
Measured on crow-recorder-central-v2, `USB_DP` is 3 components with 0 branches
— 23.6209 mm of copper and no ambiguity whatsoever. Failing that would
penalise the board for the reader's blindness, which is the adjacent-property
error this repo keeps paying for.

A MEMBER IS A CHAIN OF NETS, NOT ONE NET. pluto-cal-switch's matched arm is
three nets (`LOOP_ARM1` -> `PAD_A2A_1` -> `LOOP_ARM1_SW`) because two series
attenuator chips split it; ADR-0011's own note says the delta is measured
across the WHOLE run. So a member names an ORDERED LIST of nets and its length
is their sum. Declaring only the first net was already an authoring defect
this fleet paid for once, in the netclass.

===========================================================================
THE TOLERANCE: WHAT THE PROCESS CAN HOLD, NOT WHAT WOULD BE NICE
===========================================================================

The instinct is to write `match to 0.05 mm`. That number would be waived
inside a week, and it answers the wrong question. Four measurements decide it,
and three of them are NOT under our control:

  (a) **The vendor's own uncontrolled term is already 0.5 mm of copper.**
      PE42482A-X publishes relative insertion phase with min/typ/max
      (Table 3, PDF p8): at 6 GHz RF2-RF1 is -9.4 / -2.8 / +3.8 deg, a
      **13.2 deg window** = **1.00 mm of copper** at 13.19 deg/mm, part to
      part, on the very paths whose difference is published. Matching copper
      tighter than that buys a quantity you cannot distinguish from the
      switch you bought.
  (b) **Mounting inductance asymmetry is ~2 deg** (0.1 nH ~ 3.8 ohm at 6 GHz,
      ADR-0011 sec.3 / ADR-0006(d)) = 0.15 mm of copper, per solder fillet,
      per unit.
  (c) **JLC etch tolerance perturbs WIDTH, not centreline length** — it moves
      impedance, which is why both boards' `nets.yaml` calls the RF width an
      IMPEDANCE width and forbids "safety" widening. It is not a length term.
      The fab length terms are the outline route (+-0.2 mm, and COMMON MODE
      across notches cut by one tool path, ADR-0011 "what is NOT claimed") and
      the laminate Dk spread (+-1.7% on t_pd, common mode across two arms on
      one panel coupon; only the intra-board Dk GRADIENT is differential, and
      on a 50 mm board that is well under 1%).
  (d) **The one term that IS ours, and it is exact.** Copper length in the
      `.kicad_pcb` is a file property, deterministic to the nanometre. It
      costs nothing to hold to 1 um and nothing to measure.

**CONCLUSION, and it is the whole judgement in this file: the requirement is
not MATCHED, it is KNOWN, STABLE and REPRODUCIBLE.** Both ADRs already say so
in prose — pluto-cal-switch ADR-0011 ("a tolerance band is not a number"),
pluto-rx2-8way ADR-0006 ("what the board owes is CONSTANCY"). So the gate is
built to REPORT AND PIN, not to demand zero, and it carries two numbers with
two different jobs:

  `max_spread_mm` — **a DRIFT ceiling, derived, not a matching target.** The
      static delta is calibrated out; what CANNOT be calibrated out is how the
      delta MOVES with temperature, and ADR-0006(b) shows that term is
      proportional to the length DIFFERENCE: `dtau = TC * dT * dL * t_pd`. At
      the ESTIMATED +100 +-100 ppm/degC for FR-4 over 40 degC, dL = 1 mm gives
      0.024 ps = **0.05 deg at 6 GHz**, and dL = 20 mm (a naive rectangular
      fan-out) gives **1.05 deg**, comparable to the whole AoA budget. So
      **1.0 mm is the defensible ceiling** — it is what the by-construction
      geometry delivers with margin, it is ~1x the vendor's own part-to-part
      window, and it is derived from the drift arithmetic rather than from
      taste. `report` is a legal value and means "no ceiling, publish the
      number": an honest absence, not a silent pass.

  `pin:` — **the REPRODUCIBILITY pin, and this is the check that actually
      guards the release.** A published constant is invalidated by any
      re-route that moves the copper, and the router is stochastic. The
      declaration records the measured spread and a tolerance (0.05 mm =
      0.66 deg is a sensible resolution because it is free — see (d)); the
      gate FAILS when the board drifts off the pinned number. That converts
      "somebody re-routed and the published picoseconds are now fiction" from
      an invisible event into a red gate that forces a re-measure and a
      re-publish. **A calibration board's requirement is that the delta be
      KNOWN, STABLE and REPRODUCIBLE — not that it be zero**, and `pin:` is
      the only one of these two checks that grades that.

WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT ATTEMPT. It does not length-match anything; it
measures. **CORRECTED BY MEASUREMENT, 2026-07-29 — the sentence that used to
stand here was WRONG, and I wrote it.** It said: KRT's meander machinery is
DIFF-PAIR shaped (intra/inter-pair P/N), so single-ended inter-net skew is "a
different problem with no tool behind it here", and equalisation is therefore a
human, iterative routing task. That claim was asserted twice — here and in
pluto-rx2-8way's `nets.yaml` — WITHOUT ANYONE RUNNING THE FLAG, and it is the
reason a nine-arm AoA board whose entire release value is phase match was about
to be routed with no length matching at all.

**KRT DOES DO SINGLE-ENDED INTER-NET LENGTH MATCHING.** MEASURED on
pluto-rx2-8way: `route.py --length-match-group 'ANT*' 'RX2_OUT'
--length-match-tolerance 0.15` printed *"8 nets (0 diff pairs, 8 single-ended),
target=19.83mm"* and took the group spread **2.237 mm -> 1.1586 mm (29.5 deg ->
15.28 deg at 13.19 deg/mm)**, 11/11 routed, 0 failed, `min_clearance_used: 0.2`
— no clearance relaxation anywhere. The residual is the TOLERANCE that was
passed in, not a floor. The tool was there the whole time; what was missing was
five keys in `route_and_stitch_generic.py`'s `_KRT_FLAGMAP`
(`length_match_group`, `length_match_tolerance`, `meander_amplitude`,
`neckdown_length`, `neckdown_taper_length`), so `route.yaml` could not express
the recipe and the better route existed only as a hand-run command — a canon-M3
violation wearing a green gate. Those keys are wired now.

So equalisation is a DECLARED, REPRODUCIBLE routing step, and this gate is the
instrument that step is verified by — not a substitute for it. The lesson is
canon M1 shaped: a capability claim about a TOOL must be measured against the
tool, not inferred from reading two of its modules.

===========================================================================
THE OCTILINEAR FLOOR — WHY A CEILING MUST BE CHECKED AGAINST THE ROUTER'S
MOVE SET, FROM PADS ALONE, BEFORE A ROUTER RUNS (canon M-ENTRY)
===========================================================================

**KRT IS OCTILINEAR.** It moves on a grid in 8 directions, so the shortest
copper it can lay between two pads is not the Euclidean distance but

    oct(dx, dy) = max(dx,dy) + (sqrt(2) - 1) * min(dx,dy)

(travel `min` diagonally at sqrt(2) per unit, then `max-min` straight). That
is an EXACT lower bound on any monotone 45-degree path, and it is computable
from PAD POSITIONS ALONE — no copper, no router, no stackup.

MEASURED on pluto-rx2-8way, whose ADR-0007 claims the nine radials are "equal
length BY CONSTRUCTION":

| member  | pads                        | Euclid  | octilinear floor | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ARM_RF1 | J_ANT1.1 -> U_SW.24 | 17.7784 | 17.9628 | 1.0104 |
| ARM_RF2 | J_ANT2.1 -> U_SW.2  | 17.9725 | **19.2523** | 1.0712 |
| ARM_RF3 | J_ANT3.1 -> U_SW.4  | 18.1021 | **19.4594** | 1.0750 |
| ARM_RF4 | J_ANT4.1 -> U_SW.6  | 17.7784 | 17.9628 | 1.0104 |
| ARM_RF5 | J_ANT5.1 -> U_SW.13 | 17.7784 | 17.9628 | 1.0104 |
| ARM_RF6 | J_ANT6.1 -> U_SW.15 | 18.1021 | **19.4594** | 1.0750 |
| ARM_RF7 | J_ANT7.1 -> U_SW.17 | 17.9725 | **19.2523** | 1.0712 |
| ARM_RFC | J_RX2.1  -> U_SW.22 | 18.1021 | **19.4594** | 1.0750 |

**Euclidean spread 0.3238 mm (4.27 deg). Octilinear floor spread 1.4966 mm
(19.74 deg at 13.19 deg/mm).** Only three of the nine radials (135/225/315
deg) lie on a 45-degree multiple; the other six pay ~7% of their radius,
+1.3 mm each. The board's declared `max_spread_mm: 1.0` is therefore excluded
by the ROUTER'S MOVE SET, not by its effort — no amount of iteration budget or
clearance tuning reaches it, and ADR-0007's "equal by construction" is true of
the PLACEMENT and FALSE of the copper.

(A NUMBER CORRECTED IN PASSING: the session that found this reported the floor
spread as 1.6475 mm / 21.73 deg. That figure multiplies each arm's Euclidean
length by the octilinear factor of its IDEAL RADIAL ANGLE from the star centre
— 1.0 on the diagonals, 1.0731 at 15 deg off-axis. It is 0.15 mm pessimistic
because the switch's lands sit on a SQUARE, so the true pad-to-pad dx/dy is
not the radial dx/dy. The exact pads-alone bound is **1.4966 mm**, and even
the three "diagonal" arms cost 0.1844 mm because their QFN pad is off the
radial. Same conclusion, measured instead of idealised.)

WHAT THE FLOOR SPREAD DOES AND DOES NOT BOUND, stated precisely because the
loose version would be wrong. It is NOT a lower bound on the achievable
spread: a router can always LENGTHEN a short member to meet a long one, which
is exactly what meandering is for. What it bounds is the spread you get when
every member is routed at its shortest — i.e. the no-length-matching case. So
the finding is conditional and the gate says so: a numeric `max_spread_mm`
below the octilinear floor spread is unreachable UNLESS the route recipe
deliberately elongates. A group may declare

    elongation: meander

to claim that it does, and the gate then CROSS-CHECKS `03_src/route.yaml` for a
`length_match_group` — because the claim is only worth the recipe behind it,
and until 2026-07-29 that recipe was not expressible at all. Without the
declaration, a sub-floor ceiling is **R-LEN-OCT, a FAIL, at authoring time,
before a router has run.** That is the whole value of this check: it turns a
three-hour route-and-discover into an authoring-time error message.

`router_moves: any` disables the bound for a group routed by something with an
arbitrary-angle move set. It is an honest escape hatch and it must be declared,
not assumed — every router in this pipeline is KRT, and KRT is octilinear.

RECORDED FINDING, 2026-07-29: **NO PER-NET VIA BAN IS ENFORCED AT ROUTE
TIME.** `route_and_stitch_generic.py` and both pluto `route.yaml` files carry
no `no_vias` concept; the only mechanism is a per-WAVE `layers: [F.Cu]`
restriction, which is not per-net and is re-checked by nothing afterwards. One
via on one arm is a pure DIFFERENTIAL error on a published delta (ADR-0006(c):
a via's inductance depends on drill and plating, unspecified per hole). This
gate's `no_vias: true` is therefore the ONLY place that intent is graded, and
it is graded on the copper, after the fact, where it counts.

INDEPENDENCE (canon M1). The board is read here by a dedicated
s-expression block scanner over the shipped text — NOT through pcbnew, which
is what generated and imported the copper, and not through `pcb_toolkit.py`.
`tests/t1_copper_length.py` cross-checks this reader against pcbnew's own
`PCB_TRACK.GetLength()` on a real routed sealed board and requires per-net
agreement to 1 um, so the independence claim is MEASURED rather than asserted.

THE DECLARATION IS CHECKED WHERE IT ENTERS (canon M-ENTRY / ADR-0007). Every
net a `length_match:` group names must exist on the board, and the sibling
gate `net_reference_audit.py` (canon E-NETREF) grades the same names against
the exported netlist as kind **K12**. That coordination is not optional: the
first E-NETREF fleet sweep found **64 of 908 referenced net names absent from
their own board's netlist, 39 of them written against a DATASHEET reference
design's pin function rather than any net the board has.** A tolerance
addressed to a net that does not exist is decoration.

NOT YET WIRED INTO `policy_audit.py`, DELIBERATELY. At landing time
smc0985-cooksense was mid-battery on three order-blockers with `policy_audit`
in flight, and R-LEN's current vacuous PASS is part of that evidence run.
Re-pointing the row would move cooksense from `R-LEN PASS` to `R-LEN N-A`
inside another agent's evidence. An unwired gate plus a measurement is
recoverable in one follow-up; a corrupted seal battery is not. **The follow-up
is owed and is spelled out at the `R-LEN` row in `policy_audit.py`.**
