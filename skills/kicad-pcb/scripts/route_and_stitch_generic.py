"""route_and_stitch_generic — ONE parameterized routing + stitch/fill backend,
driven by a small declarative per-board `03_src/route.yaml`, replacing the
hand-written `03_src/route_prep.py` + `route_waves.sh` + `stitch_and_fill.py`
that every project used to carry (215-537 lines of stitcher each).

WHY. `generate_board_generic.py` collapsed the board GENERATOR; the stage
after it stayed bespoke. Surveying six shipped boards (usb-power-3s,
ble-bus-bar, crow-array-pod, cook-loadcell, crowsync-recorder, cook-hub)
showed the same pipeline every time, with different constants:

    route-prep (segment-free + unfilled + keepouts + rules ride along)
      -> KRT waves, hardest-first, chained rN -> rN+1
      -> import ONCE into the segment-free base (source vias preserved)
      -> taps (optional): collision-checked NAMED connections KRT cannot
         thread — pour-fed sense pins, boxed-in pads, plane drops
      -> stitch: clean KRT artifacts -> rescue pads -> stitch grid
                 -> janitor -> FILL -> island rescue -> heal islands -> gate
      -> generate_rules LAST (pcbnew saves clobber .kicad_pro netclasses)

    /usr/bin/python3 route_and_stitch_generic.py import  03_src/route.yaml
    /usr/bin/python3 route_and_stitch_generic.py quick   03_src/route.yaml
    /usr/bin/python3 route_and_stitch_generic.py stitch  03_src/route.yaml
    /usr/bin/python3 route_and_stitch_generic.py all     03_src/route.yaml

`prep`, `import`, `quick` and `stitch` need the KiCad-bundled interpreter
(`/usr/bin/python3`, the one with `pcbnew`). `route` only shells out to KRT
and runs on any python.

`quick` is the LOOP CHEAPENER: seconds-fast unconnected + copper
clearance/track_width verdict on the post-import pre-stitch board (no
fill, no zone classes), so a routing iteration is measured without paying
the full rebuild + DRC cycle. Full DRC after stitch stays the release gate.

LOAD-BEARING ORDER (each deviation reintroduces a debugged failure):
  * netclasses/ampacity floors exist BEFORE routing, and the route input
    carries its own .kicad_pro/.kicad_dru (canon R1) — `prep` refuses to
    run if the source .kicad_pro has no netclass patterns.
  * the route input is SEGMENT-FREE and UNFILLED — KRT routes straight
    through pre-existing segments otherwise (400+ silent crossings, twice).
    Source-owned vias remain as routing obstacles.
  * KRT output is imported ONCE, into the segment-free base, never into a
    board that already carries routed segments (that doubles everything).
  * `import` REFILLS the pours it imported into — EXCEPT when a following
    pipeline step places explicit copper before stitch's `fill` (`taps` or
    `stitch.seed_stubs`), where it must hand `import_krt.py --no-fill` so the
    later fill flows around that copper (see `_import_may_fill`).
  * `generate_rules` runs LAST, after the final pcbnew save. This script
    never writes .kicad_pro, so it cannot clobber netclasses — but the
    caller still has to re-run its rules generator afterwards, and
    `stitch` prints that reminder.

HARD ERRORS (never silent):
  * prep on a board that still has tracks or filled zones
  * prep when the route input would carry no netclasses (canon R1)
  * a wave whose EXPLICIT track_width is below a member net's netclass
    floor (nets.yaml classes) — a missing width DERIVES from the largest
    member floor instead, so a wave cannot ride under its class
  * a KRT wave naming a net the board does not have
  * a mis-shaped `length_match_group` (not a list of patterns, or not a list
    of such lists) — coercing it would route with the WRONG matched set and
    say nothing
  * a KRT wave exiting nonzero
  * an opted-in wave whose realized output violates its realized_width
    contract (the command-line width is not evidence)
  * any stitch pass falling short of its configured `min` / `require`
  * `import` onto a board that already has tracks

CONFIG SCHEMA — a skill-owned example is
`../pcb-design/templates/03_src/route.yaml` (project-independent — do NOT read
another project's config).
Relative paths resolve against the PROJECT ROOT (the yaml's grandparent dir),
so the commands work from any cwd. Top-level keys:

  project:  name, board (the pcbnew board to route/stitch), build_dir
  prep:     out, keepouts {layers, mounting_holes, npth_pads, edge_band,
            rects[]}, waves {exclude[], groups{}, rest}
  route:    krt, python, race (N concurrent chains, quick-measured best
            wins; CLI --race overrides), import_source (build|promoted),
            prefix {board, through_wave, r0_sha256, board_sha256} (optional
            reviewed, hash-bound critical prefix from which later waves resume),
            kicad_python (KiCad interpreter), ownership_preflight and
            candidate_grade {mode: observe|enforce}, exploration_guard
            {mode, plateau_attempts, max_attempts, max_novel_signatures,
            max_operation_amplification}, forbid_new_via_in_pad (compare
            every wave output with its input and refuse router-created vias
            in SMD lands), common{...}, waves[]
            {name, nets|group, realized_width (wrapper-owned output contract),
            + any KRT flag override}
  flow:     heartbeat_s, timeouts_s {route_wave, route_race,
            route_evaluate, route_import}; performance budgets are separate

`route --resume` is intentionally single-chain only. It accepts only the
contiguous prefix in route_progress.json whose route.yaml, r0, optional
reviewed route.prefix, per-wave input and output hashes still agree. Bare rN
files are never treated as evidence. A route.prefix is checked against r0 for
base-copper inheritance, physical DRC, and connected critical pairs before it
can skip any wave; stale hashes fail closed.
`route --through-wave NAME` creates that same authenticated prefix as a
deliberate stage pause, writes no FINAL marker, and resumes with `--resume`.
  taps:     clearance, via{}, connections[] {net, from, to, width,
            layer/hop_layer, plane, optional via{} geometry override and
            via_protection{capping,filling}} — see cmd_taps
  stitch:   via{}, keepin{}, passes[] (the ORDER — this is the axis the
            six boards actually disagree on), plus one block per pass;
            protect_via_in_pad can promote every realized barrel centred in
            an SMT land into one declared filled/capped drill family

The `passes` list is deliberately explicit rather than a fixed pipeline:
the survey found the stitch grid running first, middle and LAST across
boards, and it matters (the grid consumes via-exclusion zones that later
rescues must dodge).

# ============================================================= ROUTE =====
# EVERY KRT CAPABILITY THIS DRIVER CANNOT NAME IS A CAPABILITY THE PIPELINE DOES
# NOT HAVE. A key absent from this map is not a soft limitation: `_krt_args`
# hard-dies on it (t_kb_unknown_krt_flag), so a `route.yaml` that needs it
# cannot be written at all, and the only way to get the route is BY HAND — which
# is a canon-M3 violation (nothing under 03_src/ regenerates it) wearing a green
# DRC gate. That is exactly what happened on pluto-rx2-8way, 2026-07-29: the
# nine-arm AoA board whose entire release value IS phase match had to be routed
# by hand with `--length-match-group`, and the agent correctly REFUSED to promote
# the chain file because the recipe was unexpressible. Five keys were missing:
#
#   neckdown_length / neckdown_taper_length — the answer to a launch whose
#     vendor land cannot carry the impedance width. MEASURED on PE42482A-X:
#     the 0.60 x 0.30 mm land at 0.50 mm pitch puts a GND land edge 0.350 mm
#     off the RF centreline; a 0.36 mm trace needs 0.180 + 0.200 = 0.380 mm,
#     deficit 0.030 mm, so 6 of 11 rf nets routed and the five pins with GND on
#     BOTH flanks (ANT2/3/6/7, RX2_OUT) failed. Max landable width is the pad
#     width itself, 0.30 mm = 55.3 ohm, which FAILS the RF50_width floor. The
#     alternative — relaxing clearance to <= 0.17 mm — was refused for a
#     measured reason: the stitch fence would then sit 0.15-0.17 mm from a
#     0.36 mm arm (g/h ~ 0.8) and detune the pure-microstrip 50.5 ohm the width
#     was derived from. A neck-down + taper is the intended answer.
#   length_match_group / length_match_tolerance / meander_amplitude — KRT DOES
#     do SINGLE-ENDED INTER-NET length matching, contrary to what this repo
#     asserted twice before anyone ran the flag. MEASURED, same session:
#     `--length-match-group 'ANT*' 'RX2_OUT' --length-match-tolerance 0.15`
#     printed "8 nets (0 diff pairs, 8 single-ended), target=19.83mm" and took
#     the group spread 2.237 -> 1.1586 mm (29.5 -> 15.28 deg at 13.19 deg/mm),
#     11/11 routed, 0 failed, min_clearance_used 0.2 — NO clearance relaxation
#     anywhere. The residual is the tolerance that was passed in, not a floor.

    """False when the configured stitch plan places EXPLICIT COPPER before its
    `fill` — then `import` must hand `import_krt.py --no-fill`.

    THE BLOCKER THIS FIXES (2026-07-29, pluto-cal-switch). `import_krt.py` has
    had `--no-fill` since it was written and `cmd_import` never passed it, so
    every board reaching stitch through prep -> route -> import arrived with
    its zones FILLED — and `p_seed_stubs` dies on a filled zone. The backend's
    only EXPLICIT-GEOMETRY surface was therefore unreachable through the
    pipeline: the whole `stitch.seed_stubs` schema, its five fixtures and its
    contract row could only be exercised on a hand-built board. cal-switch —
    whose published artifact IS a phase delta, and which needs its two RF arms
    placed as deterministic copper (measured arm1 = arm2 = 16.080266 mm,
    spread 0.000000 mm, equal in integer nanometres) — could only get there by
    HAND-UNFILLING the board between import and stitch, correctly called that
    a diagnostic rather than a shippable path, and correctly REFUSED to promote
    the chain: a recipe not expressible in `route.yaml` is a canon-M3 violation
    wearing a green gate.

    Named `taps.connections` also place explicit copper between import and
    stitch. A pre-filled zone does not flow around their new segments/vias;
    the stale fill then reports zero-clearance and zero-hole-clearance noise
    until a later refill. Keep it unfilled so quick measures the copper that
    actually exists and stitch's declared `fill` owns the first pour.

    DERIVED, NOT DECLARED — deliberately no new config key. An opt-in
    `import.fill: false` would leave the failure mode alive (configure
    seed_stubs, forget the key, die at stitch); and the fact is already
    written down twice in the config, in `stitch.passes` and in
    `stitch.seed_stubs.stubs`. The condition is NARROW on purpose: only a
    non-empty stub list, in a pass list where `seed_stubs` precedes `fill`.
    Every other board keeps the old post-import filled state byte-for-byte,
    because the pre-`fill` stitch passes were debugged against it.

    HOLE-TO-HOLE IS DEFERRED HERE, and ONLY here (`hole_to_hole=0`). This is
    the one via emitter whose site set is a short fixed LADDER around a pad
    that cannot move, and whose only possible conflict partner is chain
    copper that a later pass can still move: `stitch.hole_to_hole` nudges

    of alternatives and must NOT create a conflict in the first place.

    MEASURED, usb-hub-3s-v3 2026-07-25: enforcing the floor here instead
    costs the board. The SW_A tap out of U2.20 sits 0.35mm from an imported
    HO_A via, so the pad site (offset 0,0 — no stub at all) is refused and
    the ladder falls to a 0.8mm stub that grazes that same via at 0.125mm
    against a 0.15mm netclass clearance. Sealed v1.5 took the pad site and
    the stitch moved the HO_A via 0.6mm east; that is the right answer, and
    it needs a repair pass, not a stricter placer. Every OTHER constraint
    (copper clearance, hole-to-copper, the stub's own path) stays hard —
    nothing downstream repairs those.

    Preserve the exact pad coordinate for the zero-offset site. Rounding a
    half-micron pad centre to the millimetre grid made `p1 != v1` and emitted
    a 0.0005mm full-width stub beside an adjacent fine-pitch signal pad."""

    WHY (2026-07-21). The DRC grind loop dominates board cost: a full
    rebuild-chain + DRC cycle on the v4 112-part board ran ~8-10 minutes
    with a frontier agent in the loop, so every routing experiment paid the
    full price. `quick` reports the two things a routing iteration can
    actually change — (a) the pcbnew ratsnest unconnected count, (b) copper
    `clearance` + `track_width` violations — in seconds, with NO fill and
    NO stitch. Zone-dependent classes are structurally absent: the zones
    are unfilled at this stage and kicad-cli without --refill-zones emits
    none. Everything else the DRC reports is counted under
    `deferred_classes` (visible, never gating — full DRC after stitch
    remains the release gate, canon: quick is a loop tool, not a gate).

    Unconnected items are split per-net: nets matching prep.waves.exclude
    (pours/stitch own them, e.g. GND) are DEFERRED and do not dirty the
    verdict — on a pre-stitch board they are unconnected by design.

    A FRACTIONAL PITCH IS A REAL REQUIREMENT, NOT A ROUNDING QUESTION. This
    was `range(int(start), int(stop), int(pitch))`, so the pitch was silently
    floored to a whole millimetre — and on an RF board the stitch grid IS the
    ground-via fence, whose pitch is derived from the guided wavelength and
    lands on numbers like 1.35 mm. MEASURED, pluto-rx2-8way-v2 (2026-07-30):
    ARCHITECTURE sec 6 requires <= 1.35 mm (the largest round value under the
    derived lambda_g/20 = 1.3693 mm, ADR-0003), the only expressible choices
    were 1 mm (a via forest, ~2500 sites) or 2 mm, and the board shipped at
    **2.0 mm = lambda_g/13.7** — conservative against the SOURCED FREE-SPACE
    lambda/20 = 2.5 mm, and NOT MEETING its own guided bound. `1.35` would
    have become `1`: not a refusal, a different board.

    THE lambda IS THE GUIDED ONE, and this is stated here so the bound is not
    left ambiguous (rf-design.md 3(b), which measured THREE methods in one
    fleet). A fence sits in the substrate alongside a microstrip, so what it
    must sample is the wave ON THE LINE, whose wavelength is
    `lambda_g = lambda_0 / sqrt(eps_eff)` — shorter than free space, hence a
    STRICTER pitch. Free-space lambda/20 is the LOOSER bound and passing it
    proves nothing about the guided one; the BULK-eps_r wavelength is neither.

    Counts are computed as `ceil((stop - start) / pitch)`, which is exactly
    `range`'s own length rule, so every integer config in this repo produces a
    BYTE-IDENTICAL site set (measured over all 13 fleet + archived + template
    configs before this landed: 0 fractional, 0 lattices moved).

    A non-positive pitch is a HARD ERROR. Pre-fix, a negative pitch made
    `range` yield nothing and the pass printed `stitch grid: 0 vias` with no
    complaint; post-fix it would not terminate. Neither is acceptable for the
    only pass that places a board's return-path stitching.

    """AUTO-HEAL same-net pour splits: a zone that FILLS as two or more
    disconnected islands (the DRC unconnected_items class whose both sides
    read `Zone [X] <-> Zone [X]`, same net). Provenance: 4 of the v4
    usb-hub-3s clean-room canary's last 7 gate findings were exactly this
    (nets LX1, LX2, VIN_S, VBUSA3 — priority-2 F.Cu converter hot-loop
    pours sliced by escape tracks, 2026-07-21), each bridged BY HAND by an
    expensive agent. This pass makes that mechanical.

    Runs AFTER `fill` (islands only exist on the filled board). Detection:
    pcbnew's own connectivity (GetConnectedItems is island-aware after
    fill) groups the net's tracks/vias/pads; each filled island is seated
    in its items' group; >= 2 groups = a split. Bridging: narrowest
    collision-clear same-layer gap first (a track at the net-class width,
    zone-min-width fallback), then a through-via where a same-net island
    on another layer overlaps both sides (the shared-plane via pair).
    EVERY emitted segment/via is verified against live copper via the
    pcb_toolkit primitives (collides / try_via->via_site_ok), the same
    discipline as `taps`; foreign-net ZONE FILLS are deliberately not
    probed — the refill re-flows them around the new copper (the toolkit's
    documented refill-after-edit contract). Then the zones are REFILLED
    and the groups RECOMPUTED: a heal that does not reduce a net's island
    group count — or that leaves ANY net split — is a hard error, never a
    silent no-op. On an already-healed board the pass emits nothing
    (idempotent), and it structurally cannot bridge nets: grouping is
    per-net and the emit path dies on a zone netcode mismatch."""

    post-fill copper polygons have positive-area overlap on a shared layer.

    precedent) and re-learned on v1.1 (3 findings, priority-2 pool + strip
    overlaps): bump the smaller zone to a distinct, higher priority so KiCad
    sees a legal NESTING instead of an intersection. Same net => the copper
    union is electrically identical; only the priority integer changes.

    SAFETY (an unbounded auto-fixer is worse than none):

    THE INCIDENT. usb-hub-3s-v3 shipped v1.6, v1.7 and v1.8 with 51 zones on
    the board and ZERO copper pour in the gerbers — 44287.91 mm2 missing, G36
    region count 0 on all four copper layers. Every gate was green, because
    `kicad-cli pcb drc --refill-zones` REFILLS IN MEMORY and therefore returns
    0/0/0 on a board whose SAVED FILE has no fill.

    `p_fill` prints "filled N zones" — a claim about an IN-MEMORY object it
    just mutated, and the last honest moment before the bytes hit disk. This
    function is the read-back: it reopens the file AS TEXT and counts what is
    actually there. Text, not pcbnew, deliberately — pcbnew is the tool whose
    save behaviour is under test, so re-reading through it would share a method
    with the thing being checked (canon M1).

    Canon M-WIDTH is why this exists at all rather than a zone-specific patch:
    this project already knew "pcbnew saves clobber NETCLASSES" and wrote the
    rule at the width of THAT incident. The law is that a save drops state not
    present in the source, and zone fill is the same class with no rule. Any
    further member found belongs in this same read-back, not in a new one.

    KEEPOUT/RULE-AREA ZONES ARE EXCLUDED: they carry no fill by design, and
    counting them would make a pour-free board look healthy.
