"""S-OCCL — schematic text occlusion, measured as GEOMETRY.

usage: /usr/bin/python3 sch_occlusion.py SHEET.kicad_sch [--max N] [--verbose]
                                         [--json OUT]

Grades one `.kicad_sch`: every glyph the sheet draws is placed on the page, and
a finding is raised where a piece of TEXT lands on top of something else — a
second text, a symbol body, a pin line, a ground/power glyph. Exit 1 if the
finding count exceeds `--max` (default 0), or if any drawable object could not
be placed (an unplaced object is not a pass — canon M-COVER).

Consumed by `policy_audit.py` as the S-OCCL row; runnable alone on any sheet.

THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES (MEASURED 2026-07-31). The shipped model, inline in
`policy_audit.py`, built a label's rectangle like this:

    if ang == 180:   # plate extends left of anchor
        items.append((gx - wlen, gy - CH_H / 2, gx, gy + CH_H / 2, ...))
    else:
        items.append((gx,        gy - CH_H / 2, gx + wlen, gy + CH_H / 2, ...))

Two facts about KiCad make that wrong, and both were measured from rendered ink
rather than reasoned about (canon M1 — the emitter must not grade its own
angles; `tests/t1_occlusion.py t_kicad_geometry_is_measured` re-derives the
whole table on every run from `kicad-cli sch export svg`):

  * A global_label's ANGLE selects only the AXIS. KiCad normalises the
    180-degree component away and `justify` ALONE selects the sense:
        (0|180, left)  -> RIGHT      (90|270, left)  -> UP
        (0|180, right) -> LEFT       (90|270, right) -> DOWN
    and a label with NO `justify` renders exactly as `left`.
    So the `else` branch above sends 90 AND 270 — the whole vertical axis — off
    to `+x`, and it reads `justify` nowhere at all, so `(0, 'right')` (a plate
    reaching LEFT) also comes out `+x`.
  * A placed symbol's local geometry is rotated CCW and then y-flipped. The old
    model had no symbol geometry of any kind: bodies, pins and ground glyphs
    were simply not on the page, so a label plate lying across a chip was
    invisible to it.

WHAT THAT COST, on the sheets themselves. Fleet-wide 68 of 1507 global labels
sit at 90/270 and were modelled on the wrong axis. On pluto-rx2-8way-v2 the old
model reads 4 findings before the converter fix at 948ef54d and 4 after, while
3 of the 4 are DIFFERENT findings — it cannot distinguish the broken sheet from
the repaired one.

=====================================================================
THE WIDTH MODEL WAS A FIXED-WIDTH MODEL OVER A PROPORTIONAL FONT
(MEASURED 2026-07-31, and it is the FOURTH inherited constant in this file
found wrong)
=====================================================================

`CH_W = 1.05` charged every character the same 1.05 mm and built a plate as
`(len(name) + 2) * CH_W`. KiCad's stroke font is PROPORTIONAL. DERIVED HERE,
independently, from 294 plates KiCad rendered itself (98 characters x 3 name
lengths, `scratchpad/derive.py` -> `t_kicad_geometry_is_measured`): every
character's advance is an EXACT integer twenty-first of the font size, k from
8 (`` ` ``) to 28 (`m`) — a 3.5x spread the flat model cannot represent. The
residual against integer k is below 0.0008 mm on all 98, which is the SVG's own
4-decimal quantisation and nothing else.

The flat model therefore errs in BOTH directions, and one of them is fatal:

    IIII                    flat 6.300 mm   true 3.753 mm   +2.547 too WIDE
    MMMMMMMM                flat 10.500     true 12.945     -2.445 too NARROW
    3V3_ANALOG_SENSE_RTN    flat 22.050     true 26.518     -4.468 too NARROW
    (the fleet's longest, 20 chars of capitals)

Too WIDE invents findings. Too NARROW makes a REAL ink composite INVISIBLE —
the gate reports a clean sheet while KiCad draws one plate through another —
and that is the direction the fleet's own names take it: 1507 global labels
over 8 sheets are drawn from `[0-9A-Z_]` only, whose advances run 20/21 and
21/21 and 22/21 of the font size against a flat model charging 1.05/1.27 =
17.4/21. THE FLAT MODEL IS TOO NARROW FOR EVERY CAPITAL LETTER IN THE FLEET.

INDEPENDENCE (canon M1). `circuit_json_to_kicad_sch.py` carries its own k/21
table, derived by the agent that wrote the de-collision pass. This one was
derived from scratch against `kicad-cli sch export svg` WITHOUT reading it,
because a checker that inherits the checked module's table is not a second
measurement. The two AGREE on all 95 printable ASCII characters. This table
additionally measures `°` (16/21), `µ` (22/21) and `Ω` (24/21) — and `Ω`
appears in fleet property text, where the converter's table would have to fall
back on its widest entry.

THREE MORE THINGS THE OLD MODEL COULD NOT SEE, all measured in the same sweep:

  * PLATE SHAPE. `PLATE_BASE` is not one number. MEASURED at three font sizes
    x three name lengths: `passive` 1.3341 mm, `input`/`output` 2.4454 mm,
    `bidirectional`/`tri_state` 3.5567 mm at the 1.27 mm font — the arrow point
    is part of the reach. Every fleet label is `passive`, so this changes no
    fleet number; it stops a non-passive sheet from being graded 1.1 to 2.2 mm
    SHORT per plate, silently.
  * FONT SIZE. The old model assumed 1.27 mm and never read the label's
    `(font (size ...))`. MEASURED: plate reach and cross extent scale EXACTLY
    linearly with size (cross/size = 2.0006 at 0.635, 1.27 and 2.54 mm). The
    size is now read; a label that does not declare one is UNPLACED, not
    guessed.
  * PROPERTY TEXT was the same defect twice over. `PROP_W = 0.82` per character
    is flat — 0.82/1.0 of the font against a true 20/21 to 24/21 for capitals,
    so `AVDD_MCU_3V3_RAIL` was modelled 17.702 mm wide against a true 19.171,
    1.47 mm SHORT. And `PROP_H = 0.53` was a SYMMETRIC half-height, while the
    ink is not symmetric about the anchor and not constant per character:
    MEASURED per character, up to 0.8719 mm above (`{`) and 1.0633 mm below
    (`)`), and on strings the FLEET ACTUALLY DRAWS up to 0.7509 above and
    1.0029 below — against 0.53 x 1.27 = 0.6731 both ways. The property box was
    0.078 mm short above and 0.330 mm short BELOW every descender on the fleet.
    Both are now per-character envelopes over the same measured table.

UPPER BOUND, ASSERTED RATHER THAN IMPLIED. A width model that can under-report
is the failure being repaired here, so the property is explicit and tested
(`t_the_model_is_an_upper_bound_on_ink`, `t_the_width_table_is_measured_from_ink`):
  * the model's plate box CONTAINS every stroke KiCad draws for that label —
    the 6-point plate polyline exactly (MEASURED: worst edge disagreement
    0.000210 mm over all 1507 fleet plates), and the glyph run strictly inside
    it with the 0.1524 mm pen counted (MEASURED: minimum margin 0.4029 mm);
  * THE ADVANCE SUM ALONE IS NOT AN UPPER BOUND, and assuming it was is how
    this file nearly shipped the same defect at one tenth the size. MEASURED
    per character: `\\` draws 0.0098 mm left of its pen origin and 0.2321 mm
    past its advance, and `_` — the fleet's commonest label character, 1234 of
    them — draws 0.1112 mm past its advance. `text_pad` carries those three
    numbers and `prop_box` applies them, so the box bounds INK rather than
    pen travel;
  * a character this table has never measured makes the object UNPLACED (a
    FAIL naming the character), not silently modelled. MEASURED: 0 such
    characters across all 8 fleet sheets.

THE MODEL IS A CENTRELINE MODEL, and that is a named residual rather than a
hidden one. KiCad strokes every glyph and every plate with a 0.1524 mm pen
(MEASURED from the render), so visible ink extends 0.0762 mm beyond every
centreline — on BOTH sides of every comparison this gate makes. Two objects
whose centreline boxes overlap therefore certainly overlap in ink; two whose
centrelines clear each other by less than 0.1524 mm may still touch in ink and
are NOT reported. The eps below is calibrated on centrelines for the same
reason: inflating the boxes instead would make every label overlap the pin it
attaches to by exactly the pen width.

TWO EARLIER CONSTANTS WERE ALSO WRONG AND BOTH ARE NOW MEASURED, one in each
direction, neither chosen to hit a number. Over 347 visible property texts and
386 rendered plates on three real sheets: a plate's CROSS-axis extent is
2.5408 mm exactly, with ZERO spread, against the shipped 2.2 (13% narrow, so
the old model was silent about real overlaps); and a property text's height is
1.0573x its font size, against a shipped HALF-height of 0.9, i.e. a box 70%
TOO TALL — which manufactured findings, and two of this model's own first-draft
findings (`label VMID x Reference R4`, `label VREF2 x Reference C_vref2b`) were
refuted against the render and disappeared when it was corrected.

FALSIFIED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS against `kicad-cli sch export svg`, on four
post-fix sheets, by matching each finding to the objects KiCad actually drew
(a label's PLATE is a 6-point polyline, a property is a `stroked-text` run):
68 of 68 text-vs-text findings CONFIRMED as real ink overlaps, 0 unconfirmed.
The converse sweep — every drawn pair whose ink overlaps that the model did NOT
report — is the declared blind spot below.

VACUITY: PIN NAME and PIN NUMBER text is not placed, so this gate PASSES a
sheet whose pin-name text is completely covered by a label plate. KiCad derives
those positions from the body edge, `pin_names (offset N)`, the hide flags and
the instance rotation, and modelling them wrongly would invent findings on
every board; the honest move is to name the gap. MEASURED by the converse ink
sweep on the post-fix sheets: 4 unreported ink-overlapping pairs on
pluto-rx2-8way-v2, 17 on pluto-cal-switch, 66 on crow-recorder-central-v2, 0 on
crow-mic-pod-v2 — and all but a few are pin-NUMBER against pin-NUMBER inside
one dense auto-generated symbol, a symbol-layout problem rather than a label
one. Fixtured by `tests/t1_occlusion.py t_vac_soccl_pin_name_text_is_not_placed`,
which asserts the gate PASSES a plate laid across a pin's NAME and then FAILS
the same plate moved onto the BODY — the contrast that separates a blind spot
from a fact the model cannot represent.

A GREEN VERDICT HERE IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT LABELS POINT AT THE RIGHT PIN. Run
`circuit_json_to_kicad_sch.py`'s de-collision pass over the PRE-FIX direction
derivation (948ef54d, where 1504 of 1504 labels carried an `anchor_side`
exactly opposite `center - anchor_position`) and the sheet emerges with ZERO
collisions while every plate still names the wrong pin: the pass MOVES plates
until nothing overlaps, and a plate fired across its own part is as movable as
any other. Legibility and correctness are different questions and this gate
answers only the first.

DECLARED SCOPE LIMIT, and it is the one that matters most on this fleet: this
grades the `.kicad_sch`. Under ADR-0002 Phase A the artifact a HUMAN reads is
tscircuit's own render, shipped as `pdf/schematic.pdf`, and NOTHING grades that
file. A clean verdict here is a statement about the machine artifact and the
KiCad gate stack that reads it, not about the schematic anyone opens. That is
exactly the premise pluto-rx2-8way-v2's withdrawn S-OCCL waiver rested on, and
the reason it was withdrawn was that nobody had checked whether the two files
agreed.

# ================================================ S-WNET — two nets, one wire
# A DISTINCT CHECK ID, NOT MORE S-OCCL, and the split is deliberate.
#
# S-OCCL asks "is this text legible" and its remedy is to MOVE A PLATE; it
# carries a per-board `soccl_max` ceiling because text crowding is a matter of
# degree. The question below is "does this sheet draw two DIFFERENT NETS as ONE
# CONDUCTOR", its remedy is to REROUTE (the emitter's `disambiguate_wires`), and
# it has no degree: one occurrence is a sheet that lies to the reader. Folding
# it into S-OCCL would make a single exit code mean two things and would let a
# net-identity defect be masked by a threshold that exists for crowded labels.
# Wires still join the S-OCCL POPULATION above as occluders — that is genuinely
# the same question — but this is a second question about the same objects.
#
# MEASURED 2026-07-31, pluto-rx2-8way-v2 `04_kicad`: 1 collinear overlap of
# 4.4450 mm between `SW_V3` and `SEL_V4` on x=89.535, plus 6 endpoint-in-interior
# T-events, junction_dot=False on every one, and zero junction dots on the whole
# 49-wire sheet.
#
# WHAT KICAD ACTUALLY DOES, measured against kicad-cli 10.0.4 on a probe sheet
# built for it (four cases, netlist export exit 0):
#     dotless T (endpoint on a foreign wire's interior)  -> nets stay SEPARATE
#     collinear overlap with no junction                 -> nets stay SEPARATE
#     junction dot at the touch point                    -> MERGED  (control)
#     shared ENDPOINT with no junction                   -> MERGED  (control)
# So the NETLIST is right and every netlist-shaped gate is honestly green. The
# lie is confined to the drawn sheet — the one artifact a human reads at
# bring-up — which is why this check reads GEOMETRY and never the netlist.
#
# INDEPENDENCE (canon M1). The emitter `circuit_json_to_kicad_sch.py` now has
# its own guard against the same defect. This one shares no code with it: its
# own parse, its own union-find, its own overlap arithmetic, and it runs on the
# FILE rather than on the emitter's in-memory segment list — so a converter that
# is wrong in the same way twice cannot be green here.
