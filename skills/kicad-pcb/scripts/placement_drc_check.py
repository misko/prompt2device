"""P-DRC: grade exact refill DRC before human placement review and routing.

An unrouted board legitimately has ratsnest ``unconnected_items`` and may
carry preliminary ``isolated_copper`` zone islands. While unrouted connections
remain, ``starved_thermal`` findings are explicitly deferred to final routed
DRC: tracks and return stitching change the available spokes. It must not reach human
review with shorts, clearance errors, invalid library links, malformed holes,
or schematic-parity defects. This checker grades KiCad's JSON report after a
fresh ``--refill-zones --schematic-parity`` run and names both denominators.

The placement allowance is deliberately not configurable: exposing an
arbitrary violation-type allowlist would let a caller suppress the very short
or clearance class this boundary exists to catch. Final routed DRC still owns
whether every preliminary island becomes connected copper and every thermal
meets its unchanged spoke requirement. No thermal is deferred on a connected
board; this placement-only verdict never grants final DRC acceptance.
