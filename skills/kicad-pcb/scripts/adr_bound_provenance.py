    python3 adr_bound_provenance.py ROOT [--adr NAME] [--no-regen]
                                    [--timeout 180] [--strict-owed]

THE INCIDENT (2026-07-29, smc0985-cooksense ADR-0024, "every pod-mateable
safety input is hardened AT THE PINOUT"). The ADR published

    General bound: V <= 0.700 V  =>  R_pd <= 592 Ohm

as the ONE-LINE TAKEAWAY of a document whose entire argument is worst-case, one
row below a table that correctly quotes the rail ceiling 3.399 V. **592 Ohm is
the NOMINAL corner** — 3.300 V, 2200 Ohm exactly, R_pd at +/-0 %. At the corner
the rest of the section uses (rail 3.399 V, injected pull-up 2178 Ohm = 2.2k
-1 %, R_pd +1 %) the bound is **559.3 Ohm**.

The 33 Ohm was not a rounding note. **560 Ohm is the only E24 value under 592,
it is the value a future pass reaches for under that ceiling, and at the
worst-case corner it produces 0.7007 V and FAILS by 0.7 mV.** The published
bound permitted exactly one standard value and that value does not clear. The
chosen 470 Ohm is unaffected (+91.7 mV), so the board was never wrong — the ADR
was. THE FAILURE IS THE ONE THE ADR IS NAMED AFTER, REPRODUCED IN ITS OWN
SUMMARY LINE: a remedy quoted at a corner the decision does not use.

AND IT IS NOT ONE DOCUMENT — canon M-WIDTH says name the CLASS and enumerate its
known members, so here they are, all found by re-deriving 108 published bounds
across 37 ADRs on 2026-07-29:

  1. cooksense ADR-0024, `R_pd <= 592 Ohm` — above. Corrected in the body since;
     the CLASS is what this gate closes.
  2. **cooksense ADR-0018 line 213, `V <= 1.0 V => R >= 1 564 Ohm`, AND IT IS
     STILL PUBLISHED.** In a section whose heading reads, verbatim, "WORST CASE,
     INJECTED PULL-UP — must stay under `V_GS(th)` MIN = 1.0 V", the table's own
     column header is `3.3 · 680/(680+R)`. 3.3 V is the NOMINAL rail; the board's
     `power_tree.yaml` declares 3V3 `vout_max: 3.399`, and the ADR itself takes
     the rail "at its LOW end, 3.201 V" forty lines earlier for the opposite
     direction *because a low rail is the worst case for clearing a threshold*.
     At 3.399 V the bound is **1 631.3 Ohm** (1 647.6 with R_COILENPD +1 %), so
     the published bound admits E24 **1.60 k** (1.0137 V), E96 **1.58 k**
     (1.0227 V) and E96 **1.62 k** (1.0049 V) — and NOT ONE OF THEM CLEARS. Same
     shape, same board, same week, in the ADR that ADR-0024 EXTENDS. The safety
     claim survives (every tabulated pod pull-up still clears at 3.399 V), so
     this is a wrong published bound rather than a wrong board — which is exactly
     why nothing that reads copper could find it.
  3. usb-hub-3s-v3 ADR-0003, `PASS <= 300 uA` — the board's own
     `power_tree.yaml` retired it in writing ("**PASS <= 1.00 mA**, re-derived
     2026-07-27. The old `<= 300 uA` WOULD HAVE FAILED A GOOD BOARD"), because
     two LM5116 UVLO dividers were missing from the budget. The ADR was never
     amended. A gate that cannot PASS, published as a bound.
  4. crow-recorder-central-v2 ADR-0007, a v-next `F_BEEP` PTC at `~1.1 A hold`
     naming MINISMDC110F. Six pods fire together off one shared driver = 0.900 A,
     and this repo's own derating (ADR-0002's 6 A -> 4.8 A at 50 C, x0.8) puts the
     named part at 0.880 A. **The bound names one purchasable part and that part
     nuisance-trips.** cooksense's 560 Ohm with a different unit.

Same class, same day, different artifact: a hand-derived silk-stroke threshold
entered two canon files and was wrong TWICE — 0.9375 mm is the board-silk figure
and 0.75 mm the refdes figure, because "the generator" was two generators all
along. **A RULE ABOUT A QUANTITY MUST NAME ITS EMITTER AND ITS CORNER.**

So this gate is the ADR analogue of canon M4's `evidence:` schema on
`policy_waivers.yaml` (`waiver_provenance.py`): a load-bearing number stops
being a digit and becomes A COMMAND AND ITS OUTPUT, re-run and diffed. The
vocabulary, the ladder and the monotone ratchet are REUSED VERBATIM from that
gate — deliberately not a second dialect — and the read-only denylist and
number parsers are IMPORTED from it rather than copied.


================================================================================
THE SCHEMA
================================================================================

An ADR declares one block per published inequality: a line reading exactly
`<!-- bound -->` (or `<!-- bound: ID -->`), immediately followed by a fenced
```yaml block. Anything else in the ADR is prose and is read by nothing.

    <!-- bound: R_PD_MAX -->
    ```yaml
    id: R_PD_MAX
    claim: >-
      Largest safety pull-down that keeps V(DOOR_RAW) under V_T-(min) 0.700 V
      with a cross-mated pod's 2.2k SCL pull-up injected.
    relation: "<="
    value: 559.3               # THE PUBLISHED BOUND. The typed number.
    unit: Ohm

    command: /usr/bin/python3 .../divider.py --solve --corner worst_case
    governs:                   # WHAT the bound is a bound ON
      evaluate: /usr/bin/python3 .../divider.py --corner worst_case --r {value}

        board stocks no E96 resistors.

    ```

`command` is re-run from the REPO ROOT and its last stdout line must carry
exactly one number, which is diffed against `value`. `governs.evaluate` carries
a `{value}` placeholder and is run TWICE MORE, and those two runs are the whole
insight of this gate:

  1. **AT THE PUBLISHED BOUND ITSELF.** A bound sits on its own budget edge at
     the corner it was derived at, and nowhere else. Evaluating 559.3 Ohm at
     `worst_case` gives 0.699967 V against `<= 0.700`; evaluating **592.3 Ohm**
     at `worst_case` gives **0.732420 V** and violates it by 32.4 mV. That
     single run reproduces the ADR-0024 incident FROM THE DOCUMENT ALONE, with
     no second opinion and no sibling corner needed: a bound whose own value is
     inadmissible under its own budget WAS NOT DERIVED AT THE CORNER IT
     DECLARES.
     THE BOUND IS NUDGED INWARD BY ITS OWN DECLARED `tolerance` FIRST, and that
     is not a softening — it is the only way a ROUNDED bound can be graded at
     all. The exact worst-case solution is 559.2830 Ohm and the ADR publishes
     559.3, which at 559.3 evaluates to 0.700017 V: strictly over, by 17 uV of
     rounding. So the value tested is `559.3 - tolerance`, and a bound that
     rounds must therefore DECLARE the tolerance it rounded by — which B-TOL
     then keeps honest. 592.3 - 0.05 still gives 0.732371 V and still fires.
  2. **AT THE NEAREST STANDARD VALUE.** A bound is not a number, it is a number
     PLUS THE SET OF PARTS YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUY. The nearest series value
     admissible under the bound — the largest for `<=`/`<`, the smallest for
     `>=`/`>` — is re-evaluated at the declared corner, and a bound whose only
     admissible standard value FAILS THERE is a FAIL, not a rounding note.
     560 Ohm under a 592 Ohm ceiling at worst_case: 0.7007 V. Fails by 0.7 mV.

WHY THE SERIES IS DECLARED PER BOUND AND NEVER ASSUMED. Which E-series applies
is a SOURCING fact, not an arithmetic one, and the answer changes the verdict:
under 592.3 Ohm, E24 admits 560 and E96 admits 590 — both fail here, but a
`decade`/`explicit` set naming only what the board stocks may admit 470 and
pass. A safety pull-down and a decoupling cap are not sourced from the same
series, so a global default would be a single number standing in for two
different supply chains: exactly the "the generator was two generators" defect
above, one level up. `series:` and `series_why:` are both mandatory, and
`explicit: [...]` is the honest spelling of "the board's own preferred set".

CHECKS
  B-SCHEMA   the block is not a mapping, carries an unknown key (a misspelled
             `commmand:` must not degrade silently back into prose), omits a
             required key, declares a `corner:` outside
             {nominal, worst_case, typical}, or `value:` does not carry exactly
             one number. A bound with no `governs:` is prose with a colon in it.
  B-GRADE    `grade:` is not CITED / ESTIMATED; a CITED bound carries no
             `command` (a citation claim with nothing cited); an ESTIMATED bound
             carries no `why_not_rerunnable:`.
  B-CMD      a declared command is not READ-ONLY. This gate EXECUTES what the
             ADR says, and an audit that can write is not an audit. The denylist
             is `waiver_provenance.MUTATING`, imported rather than copied.
  B-REGEN    `command` ran, printed a number, and it DISAGREES with the
             published `value:` by more than `tolerance`.
  B-CORNER   `governs.evaluate` at the PUBLISHED VALUE (nudged inward by the
             declared `tolerance`) violates `governs.budget` — the bound does not
             sit on its own edge at the corner it declares, so it was derived at
             a DIFFERENT corner. This is the ADR-0024
             defect and it FAILS ON THAT ALONE, whether or not any standard
             value clears and whether or not `command` was runnable. When
             `corner_commands:` names sibling corners, the finding also says
             WHICH corner the published number does reproduce at.
  B-STDVAL   the nearest standard value admissible under the bound, re-evaluated
             at the declared corner, VIOLATES the bound's own budget. The bound
             permitted a value that cannot be bought and made to work.
  B-SERIES   a `standard_value:` block with no `series`, an unshort
             `series_why`, an unknown series name, or a `decade`/`explicit` set
             that is empty. An assumed series is a verdict nobody chose.
  B-FLIP     the value the ADR says it CHOSE satisfies the published bound and
             does NOT satisfy the regenerated one (or the reverse). THE
             DECISION'S OWN CONCLUSION REVERSES. Reported separately from
             B-REGEN — 592.3 against 559.3 is not a 33 Ohm discrepancy when the
             chosen part sits between them, it is a reversed verdict — and NO
             TOLERANCE EXCUSES IT. (cooksense chose 470 Ohm, which clears both,
             which is exactly why that board is fine and the ADR was not.)
  B-TOL      `tolerance` present without `tolerance_why`, or a tolerance >= the
             MARGIN the bound must discriminate: the smallest distance from the
             published value to a value the bound has to rule on — `chosen` and
             the nearest standard value. 559.3 Ohm with 510 Ohm as the nearest
             E24 value has 49.3 Ohm to work with, so a 50 Ohm tolerance cannot
             distinguish pass from fail and is not a tolerance. THIS IS THE
             CHECK THAT STOPS THE FIX FROM RECREATING THE DEFECT IT CLOSES: the
             tolerance is itself a load-bearing number.

THE LADDER, verbatim from canon M-IMPORT via `waiver_provenance` — for a number
that cannot be regenerated HERE AND NOW:

  CITED      command ran, printed one number, agrees within tolerance.
  UNVERIFIED a command exists but produced no number here — a declared
             `requires:` absent, a timeout, or a non-zero exit. Named on every
             run, credited to nobody, and deliberately NOT A FAIL: one board is
             mid-rebuild and two are mid-route as this lands, and a gate whose
             verdict turns on whether a sibling agent is regenerating copper is
             a gate that gets switched off inside a week. The hole that opens is
             closed FROM THE OTHER SIDE by `CITED_FLOOR`, so a citation that
             stops reproducing fails.
  ESTIMATED  no command is possible; `why_not_rerunnable:` says why. Legal,
             reported, never counted as CITED.
  OWED       an ADR that publishes a numeric inequality bound and declares no
             `bound:` block at all — 37 of 78 ADRs on the day this landed.
             Named document by document, counted, ceiling-pinned.

THE RATCHET. 37 ADRs carry a bound and 0 declare anything, so a day-one mandate
lands as 37 red documents and gets switched off. Coverage is REPORTED, every
OWED document is printed BY NAME, and only two COUNTING facts can fail — CITED
dropping below `CITED_FLOOR` and OWED rising above `OWED_CEILING`. Everything
else that fails is a number that DISAGREED, a corner that was MISLABELLED, or a
standard value that is INADMISSIBLE. The direction is what makes it monotone:
the existing 37 are a named debt, and the next ADR that publishes a bound must
either declare it or raise the ceiling in the same commit, naming the run.

THE BLIND SPOT THIS LEAVES OPEN, stated exactly (canon G-VACUOUS; declared as
prose rather than as a `VACUITY:` block ON PURPOSE — binding one requires
raising `gate_contract_audit.VACUITY_FLOOR` from 5 to 6, and that file is owned
elsewhere in this session. The one-line patch and its fixture are in the
accompanying report, and this gate is OWED under G-VACUOUS until then. Its
executable half already exists as
`t1_adr_bounds.py:t_blindspot_a_bound_typed_only_in_prose_is_read_by_nothing`,
subject-then-contrast.)

  1. EVERY CHECK HERE GRADES ONLY WHAT A BLOCK DECLARES. A bound typed in ADR
     prose is read by nothing, and on the day this landed that was **37 of 37
     documents, 108 inequality bounds, 0 CITED** — the incident bound itself
     included, in its original form. That is why OWED is enumerated by name on
     every run rather than left as a silent zero.
  2. B-CORNER CATCHES A MISLABELLED CORNER, NOT A BADLY CHOSEN ONE. An ADR that
     declares `corner: nominal` and does its arithmetic at nominal is internally
     consistent and PASSES, even when the document's whole argument is
     worst-case — which is the ADR-0024 incident with the label told honestly.
     The gate can prove a bound was derived somewhere other than where it says;
     it cannot prove that where it says is the right place. THE CONTRAST, and
     what makes this a blind spot rather than a fact the gate cannot represent:
     the same 592.3 Ohm bound labelled `worst_case` is caught by name, twice
     (B-CORNER on its own edge, B-STDVAL on 560 Ohm).
  3. `governs.evaluate` IS THE ADR AUTHOR'S ARITHMETIC, not this gate's. That
     separation is canon M1 on purpose — the gate owns the LADDER, the SERIES
     and the RELATION, and never the physics — and the price is that an
     `evaluate` command wrong in the same direction as the bound agrees with it.
     A second opinion on the physics is `electrical_invariants.yaml`'s job
     (ADR-0007 node_level), not this gate's.

FLEET DENOMINATOR, measured by this script on 2026-07-29 at main tip: **78 ADRs
(7 repo-level + 71 across 6 live boards); 37 carry at least one numeric
inequality bound** (`<=`, `>=`, the unicode `<=`/`>=`, followed by a number),
**108 such bounds in total**, densest smc0985-cooksense ADR-0023 at 10, and
**0 declare a `bound:` block**. A bare `<` or `>` is deliberately NOT counted:
it collides with markdown/HTML and with prose arrows, and over-counting the
denominator would inflate the debt rather than describe it.
