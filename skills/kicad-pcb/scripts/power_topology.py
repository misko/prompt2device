"""POWER-TREE gate battery (E-TOPO / E-MARGIN / E-OFF) — three mechanical
commission-stage checks DERIVED from 03_src/rules/power_tree.yaml, so
converter topology, output-setpoint load margin, and de-energization are
gated numbers, not things a reviewer has to remember to eyeball.

  E-TOPO  - converter topology DERIVED from Vin-vs-Vout (this file's original
            job).                                        [default invocation]
  E-MARGIN- a regulated rail feeding a KNOWN load must clear the load's
            brownout with real IR headroom.                       [--margin]
  E-OFF   - a self-contained energy source (battery/cell/pack) must document
            its de-energization path + bounded stored quiescent draw.
                                                             [--off-control]

WHY E-TOPO EXISTS
-----------------
usb-hub-3s (2026-07-22) was built with an IP6559 BUCK-BOOST SoC for its USB-C
port plus a 16 A input trunk — but the USB-C output is 5 V ONLY and the battery
is 9-12.6 V, so Vout(5 V) < Vin_min(9 V) ALWAYS: a simple step-down BUCK
suffices. The buck-boost (+ 4 external FETs + 30 V-FET/TVS coordination +
compact hot-loop congestion + a 16 A trunk) existed only to support >5 V PDOs
the spec never required. Root cause: D-SPEC pinned the CURRENT ("5 A compliant")
but never the OUTPUT VOLTAGE RANGE, and the converter TOPOLOGY was interpreted,
not DERIVED from Vin vs Vout. This gate closes that loop.

WHY E-MARGIN EXISTS
-------------------
usb-hub-3s-v3 (2026-07-23, external review): a rail regulated to 4.97 V fed a
Raspberry Pi 5 (undervoltage detect ~4.63 V) at 5 A - leaving only
(4.97-4.63)/5 A ~= 68 mOhm of TOTAL budget for board + connector + cable IR
drop. A real e-marked 5 A USB-C cable + two connector pairs alone exceeds that,
so the Pi browns out under load. BOTH zero-context red-team reviews COMPUTED the
4.97 V setpoint and neither flagged the thin margin. E-MARGIN makes the headroom
a number: for a rail that declares its load's undervoltage threshold, the
setpoint headroom must buy more series resistance than the delivery path will
burn at Imax (with margin). The cable/connector ASSUMPTION is a judgment call
([H], red-team checklist); the arithmetic once assumed is [M] here.

WHY THE feedback: TOLERANCE WINDOW EXISTS (E-TOPO + E-MARGIN)
------------------------------------------------------------
usb-hub-3s-v3 (2026-07-23, external review): the gate accepted AUTHOR-DECLARED
vout_min/vout_max, and the author computed the window from ONLY the regulator
reference tolerance (Vref +/-1.5%) — omitting the feedback DIVIDER resistors'
tolerances. Real window for the USB-C rail (Vref 1.215 +/-1.5%, R12 4.12k
+/-0.1%, R13 1.21k +/-1%): 5.227-5.479 V; declared: 5.27-5.43 V. Every check
downstream of the window (E-MARGIN headroom, the TVS-standoff comparison) was
graded against corners the board cannot hold. The OPTIONAL per-rail
`feedback:` block makes the corners COMPUTED, not declared:

  feedback: {vref, vref_tol_pct, r_top_ohm, r_top_tol_pct,
             r_bottom_ohm, r_bottom_tol_pct,
             r_top_tcr_ppm_per_C, r_bottom_tcr_ppm_per_C,
             resistor_temperature_delta_C}
  vout = vref * (1 + r_top/r_bottom)
  total resistor tolerance = initial tolerance + |TCR| * |delta temperature|
  computed low  = vref_min * (1 + r_top_min / r_bottom_max) + Ifb_min*Rtop_min
  computed high = vref_max * (1 + r_top_max / r_bottom_min) + Ifb_max*Rtop_max

When present: a DECLARED window NARROWER than the computed one is a FAIL in
both E-TOPO and E-MARGIN (the author under-stated the corners), and E-MARGIN
grades headroom from the COMPUTED worst-low, not the declared vout_min.
Absent -> behavior unchanged (declared window taken at face value).

WHY E-OFF EXISTS
----------------
usb-hub-3s-v3 (2026-07-23, external review): a 3S-LiPo board tied both buck EN
pins active with no master switch - so the controllers idle-drain the pack the
whole time it sits in storage. No review asked "how is it de-energized / does it
self-drain?". E-OFF makes a battery board DECLARE its de-energization path
(off_control) and its stored quiescent draw (quiescent_ua); an always-on design
must be an explicit ADR decision, never a silent default. Whether the declared
mechanism actually exists in the netlist, and whether the drain is acceptable
for the pack, are [H] (the mandatory input-protection ADR + the red-team
checklist).

THE PHYSICS (deterministic — this is the whole check)
-----------------------------------------------------
  Vout_max < Vin_min  -> BUCK        (step-down only)
  Vout_min > Vin_max  -> BOOST       (step-up only)
  ranges overlap      -> BUCK_BOOST  (must do both)

That derivation gives the step-down/step-up REQUIREMENT. The converter part
supplies an IMPLEMENTATION of it, and the two are graded against each other:
  - MORE capable than needed (buck_boost where buck suffices) = OVER-ENGINEERING
    -> FAIL. Waiver-able only with an ADR justifying the extra capability
    (e.g. "future 20 V PD"); the waiver is applied by policy_audit's E-TOPO row.
  - LESS capable (buck where boost is required) -> FAIL: cannot meet Vout.

WHY `LINEAR` EXISTS (2026-07-27) — AND WHY IT IS NOT A FOURTH TOPOLOGY
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Until this change `normalize_type()` accepted only buck / boost / buck_boost,
while `converter:` was REQUIRED on every rail. An LDO-only board therefore had
no legal way to declare its power tree at all: naming the LDO raised
"type 'ldo_regulator_fixed_3v3' does not classify as buck/boost/buck_boost"
and exited 2. **The only way to a green E-TOPO was to DELETE power_tree.yaml**,
which returns N-A and exit 0 — a gate silently grading nothing, the exact
M-COVER class this gate battery exists to police, living inside our own gate.

Three fleet boards were already routing around it when this was fixed:
  * smc0985-cooksense       `rails: []` plus a parallel `linear_rails:` key
                            the checker IGNORES BY DESIGN — six documented
                            rails, all ungraded, and E-TOPO printing N-A.
  * crow-recorder-central   two LDO rails (1V8 TCR2LF18, 3V3A XC6227) present
                            only as a comment block; two of four rails graded.
  * crow-recorder-central-v2  the same two rails, the same comment.
`pluto-cal-switch` declared its LDO rail truthfully instead, took the exit 2,
and reported the gap — which is how it got fixed.

A linear regulator is NOT a fourth topology. It is one IMPLEMENTATION of the
step-down requirement, so it is derived and graded like this:

  required BUCK        + LINEAR -> the requirement is met; now grade the two
                                   things that actually kill a linear part
  required BOOST       + LINEAR -> FAIL: a linear regulator cannot step up
  required BUCK_BOOST  + LINEAR -> FAIL: Vin dips into/below Vout, so the part
                                   drops out of regulation somewhere in the
                                   declared envelope

and "the two things that actually kill a linear part" are DROPOUT and
DISSIPATION, both of which the buck/boost derivation is blind to:

  headroom = vin_min - vout_max          must be >= dropout_mv
  PD       = (vin_max - vout_min) * iout must be <= pdiss_max_mw

Both numbers are REQUIRED for a LINEAR rail, from the converter's `part.yaml`
(`dropout_mv:`, `pdiss_max_mw:`) or overridden on the rail. Making them
optional would recreate the defect one level down: a rail that declares a
linear converter and no bounds is a rail this gate cannot grade, and per
canon M-COVER that is a FAIL, not a pass. `pluto-cal-switch` had both numbers
already — as a prose comment nothing could read (PD 195 mW into a SOT-23 rated
300 mW). That is the ADR-0004 shift-left move: prose becomes a field.

The over-engineering verdict is UNCHANGED and still fires: buck_boost where
buck or boost suffices is still a FAIL. LINEAR adds no new over-capability
axis — a linear regulator is strictly less capable than a buck, so its risk is
under-capability, which is what dropout and dissipation measure.

INPUT-CURRENT (advisory, always PRINTED)
----------------------------------------
Worst-case input trunk current = Sum(vout_max * iout_max)/eff / Vin_min across
all rails sharing the input. Always printed so the 16 A-vs-7 A class of mismatch
is visible. If an input trunk class current is declarable UNAMBIGUOUSLY (nets.yaml
netclass named as the input trunk, or `input_trunk_class:` in power_tree.yaml)
and it is MATERIALLY BELOW the derived worst case, that is under-built copper ->
FAIL. A trunk/fuse sized > 2x the derived need is OVER-built -> advisory FLAG
(the usb-hub-3s incident on the current axis), never a false-FAIL.

USAGE
-----
  power_topology.py PROJECT_DIR
      E-TOPO: grade every rail's converter topology in
      PROJECT_DIR/03_src/rules/power_tree.yaml.
      Exit 0 all-pass, 1 on any topology/under-built FAIL, 2 on a load/config
      error (bad schema, missing vout range). No power_tree.yaml -> N-A, exit 0.

  power_topology.py PROJECT_DIR --margin
      E-MARGIN: for every rail that declares load_uv_threshold, grade the
      output-setpoint headroom against the delivery IR drop at Imax. A rail
      declares its worst case with ir_budget_mohm (board+connector+cable series
      resistance); a rail that omits it is graded against the ir_floor_mohm
      floor (default 100 mOhm). Exit 0 pass/N-A, 1 on any FAIL, 2 on a load
      error.

  power_topology.py PROJECT_DIR --off-control
      E-OFF: if a self-contained energy source (battery/cell/pack) is detected
      (source_type:, or VBAT/BATT/PACK nets, or a battery ADR), require
      off_control: + quiescent_ua: to be declared; an always-on off_control with
      no ADR reference is a FAIL. Exit 0 pass/N-A, 1 on any FAIL.

  power_topology.py --derive VIN_MIN VIN_MAX VOUT_MIN VOUT_MAX
      Print the derived topology for an ad-hoc range and exit 0 (calibration).

  --power-tree PATH / --nets PATH   override the auto-located files.

Netlist-independent: reads part.yaml `type:` + the rule YAMLs; runs on any
python3 with PyYAML.

VACUITY: (canon G-VACUOUS — the input class on which this gate PASSES while the
fact it grades is FALSE, fixtured by `t1_power_topology.py`
`t_vacuity_E_OFF_is_N_A_on_a_battery_board_that_declares_nothing`.)

E-OFF grades "a self-contained energy source has an off_control and a declared
quiescent draw". `detect_energy_source` finds that source three ways: the
`source_type:` field of `03_src/rules/power_tree.yaml`, a net matching
VBAT/BATT/PACK, or a battery-ish word in the FILENAME PLUS FIRST 400 CHARACTERS
of a `01_docs/decisions/*.md`. When none hits it returns `("unknown", ...)` and
E-OFF reports **N-A, exit 0**.

So a board that really does carry a cell and declares no `source_type:`, names
its rail something other than VBAT/BATT/PACK, and mentions the cell only past
character 400 of an ADR (or in `BRIEF.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md`, neither of which
is scanned) gets a silent pass on the whole de-energization contract. The
conservatism is deliberate and the code says so; what is undeclared is that the
escape is REACHABLE BY DEFAULT — declaring nothing is the least effort path.

MEASURED, and this is the correction to a report that had it the other way
round: the ADR scan is `re.search(r"batter|lipo|li[-_ ]?ion|\bcell\b|\bpack\b|
discharge", head, re.I)` and it is NEGATION-BLIND — the sentence "this board has
no battery backup" returns `("battery", "ADR ...")`. That direction makes E-OFF
STRICTER (exit 1 demanding off_control on a USB-only board), so it is a FALSE
FAIL, not a false pass, and it is not this gate's vacuity condition. The
`_BATT_RE` at module level never sees prose at all; it is matched only against
`power_tree.yaml`'s own `source_type:` string.

    A SWITCHING rail draws CONSTANT POWER: Iin = Pout/eff / Vin, so the input

    the pass element is in series with the load, so Iin = Iout (+Iq) whatever
    Vin does, and its input power is Vin*Iout, not Vout*Iout/eff.

    Modelling a linear rail with the switching formula UNDER-STATES its trunk
    current by exactly Vout/Vin. pluto-cal-switch's power_tree.yaml wrote
    `eff: 1.0` on its LDO rail with the comment that this "makes the derived
    input-trunk current equal the output current, which is the physically
    correct answer for a linear pass element" — it does not: at Vout 3.3 /
    Vin_min 4.4 it gives 0.075 A for a rail that draws 0.100 A, 25% light.
    A rail carries `topo` once grade_rail() has resolved its converter; a rail
    without one is treated as switching, which is the pre-existing behaviour.
